    Content:
      "<h2>Analytics provider also triples the size of its Vancouver headquarters in response to business growth.</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</strong> -<strong> </strong>Visier, an innovation leader in workforce analytics and planning, announced today that it has opened a new office in San Jose, California, in response to the dramatic increase in demand for the company’s cloud solutions. The office will house Visier’s growing sales and marketing team. Visier has also relocated its Vancouver headquarters to a new facility, making space for the company’s rapidly growing product development and customer success workforce.\n\nWith the San Jose office, Visier will be geographically located near several important stakeholders, including a number of the company’s customers, such as Informatica, Concur, and Synopsys.\n\n\"It's great to have Visier open an office down the road from Concur. Like Visier, Concur is experiencing rapid growth. Visier lets us unify disparate sets of data from our multiple HR systems to get the insights we need to manage and optimize our growth. I haven’t seen any other tool that can do that in such an easy way,” says Charles Mah, VP, Global Talent Acquisition, Concur.\n\n“I am excited by the opportunities we now have with Visier to deliver real-time drill-down analytics to help us drive timely decision making. Visier represents a leap forward from static reporting into dynamic analytics. We are partnering with this growing company and looking forward to even more functionality and user applications,” says Kevin Syvrud, VP, Global Operations, Human Resources, Synopsys.\n\nThe San Jose office opening is the latest development in the company’s growth. In October 2013, Visier moved its Vancouver office to a space in the Mount Pleasant technology hub in Vancouver. Over the next year, the company plans to add new employees in Vancouver and San Jose to strengthen resources across all functions, including sales, marketing, product development, and customer success.\n\nA Big Data solution, Visier® Workforce Analytics enables organizations to discover critical workforce insights in areas such as employee turnover, performance, and retention, based on data from all available sources. With Visier® Workforce Planning, which will be generally available in February 2014, organizations can build optimal workforce plans based on historical trends combined with sophisticated scenario modeling.\n\n“It is very rewarding to experience how our unique approach is helping our customers to gain confidence in their data and consequently make much better business decisions. By turning the traditional business intelligence approach upside down – starting with the real and practical business questions rather than with data sources and technical architectures – we are enabling our customers to get from data to insight an order of magnitude faster and cheaper,” says John Schwarz, Co-Founder and CEO of Visier.\n\nUnlike traditional Business Intelligence projects, which take a year or more to implement, Visier unifies data from multiple, otherwise disparate sources, and translates that data into the most important workforce insights – in four to eight weeks. Instead of giving customers the tools to build applications, Visier delivers a complete cloud-based solution, enabling HR, Finance, and business leaders to make better informed, fact-based decisions.\n\n<strong>About Visier</strong>\n\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask. Questions that shape business strategy, provide the impetus for taking action, and drive better business results.\n\nVisier delivers fast, clear people insight by using all the available people data—regardless of source. With best-practice expertise built-in, decision-makers can confidently take action. Thanks to our amazing customers, Visier is the market leader in Workforce Analytics with 5,000 customers in 75 countries around the world.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.visier.com.\n\nMedia Contact:\nSarah Grant\nVisier\n514-436-5100\nsarah(dot)grant(at)visier(dot)com",

      "Visier's New Solution Gives HR Agile, Predictive Workforce Planning Capabilities",
    Content:
      '<h2>Cloud solution allows enterprises to capitalize on Big Data - without IT investment - to forecast, model, and analyze multiple workforce scenarios</h2>\n&nbsp;\n<div>\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN FRANCISCO, CA -</strong> Visier, an innovation leader in workforce analytics, announced today the launch of Visier® Workforce Planning. The new cloud solution enables organizations to leverage data from unlimited sources to predict how workforce behaviors (such as future employee recruitment, promotion, and turnover patterns) will change, and use this insight to create, analyze and collaborate on plans to optimize the workforce. With Visier Workforce Planning, HR can plan more strategically, while taking changing market conditions into account.\n\n"The most impactful work my team will undertake in the next several years is the implementation of workforce planning. For our company, a one percent improvement in this area translates into several million dollars in benefit. With the ability to further leverage our investment in Visier Workforce Analytics, Visier\'s workforce planning solution will help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of our planning assumptions, and optimize our analysis and forecasting capabilities," says Mark Berry, VP of People Insights, ConAgra Foods.\n\nPlanning is often a complex and cumbersome process that is ad hoc in nature, and involves manual entry into antiquated custom-built spreadsheets. As a result, workforce planning typically happens just once a year and fails to involve front line leaders in the organization. Visier\'s new solution turns workforce planning into an automated, highly collaborative process, where decisions are made based on up-to-date insights into an organization\'s own workforce data and trends, with an immediate linkage to associated costs.\n\n"The financial crisis and economic downturn turned traditional budgeting and business planning on its head, demanding an unprecedented level of agility. With this solution, we are empowering HR to spend less time searching for information, and more time planning effectively for the future," says John Schwarz, Co-Founder and CEO of Visier.\n\nVisitors to the HR Technology Conference in Las Vegas, October 7-9, 2013, can see Visier Workforce Planning in action at booth #1637. The solution allows organizations to securely access their current and historical data to:\n<ul>\n \t<li style="list-style-position: inline;">Ensure starting-point data is accurate</li>\n \t<li style="list-style-position: inline;">Generate credible projections based on past trends</li>\n \t<li style="list-style-position: inline;">Create "What If" scenarios to explore different options</li>\n \t<li style="list-style-position: inline;">Instantly toggle between required people resources, and their costs</li>\n \t<li style="list-style-position: inline;">Unlock wisdom otherwise trapped on the front line</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Visier\'s Technology Advantage</strong></h3>\nVisier\'s unique technology lets organizations mine data from multiple internal and external sources to gain workforce insights that lead to better business decision making. Unlike BI projects, which take a year or more to implement, Visier can extract data from multiple, otherwise disparate sources, and translate that data into the most important workforce insights - in a month.\n\nThe one critical element that most business technology solutions fail to deliver is an engaging and rewarding user experience. Visier has differentiated itself by creating a visually appealing, intuitive and interactive interface. This empowers HR to spend less time searching for information, and more time strategizing.\n<div><strong style="line-height: 1.125em;">About Visier</strong></div>\n</div>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      "<h2>Visier's Summer'13 release of Visier Workforce Analytics unveils unparalleled benchmarking and comparative analysis technology that allows organizations to seamlessly analyze, measure and compare workforce performance relative to industry experience</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC -</strong> Visier, an innovation leader in workforce analytics, announced today the immediate availability of their Summer'13 release of Visier Workforce Analytics, which includes leading-edge benchmarking technology. The new capability allows organizations to measure and compare their own workforce performance against industry \"best practice\" experience, enabling more informed and effective workforce management.\n\nVisier continues on its mission to revolutionize business use of information for everyday decision-making by unveiling the next generation of workforce analytics. Building on the foundation of delivering truly insightful workforce analytics and planning solutions, Visier has extended its leadership in delivering innovation with the Summer'13 release. Building on the comparative analysis innovation in the Spring'13 release that delivered new ways to visually explore relationships and compare workforce data side-by-side and over time, the Summer'13 release extends this capability with the inclusion of relevant external data that is seamlessly integrated with an organization's own data. With more and more data, HR professionals and business leaders face greater challenges in determining what data is important. Benchmarks and external experience provide an invaluable context to gauge whether an organization is on-track or needs a critical course correction. Decision makers need instant insight for assessing performance across such topics as diversity, labor markets, and employment costs to uncover critical insights in their workforce data that require action. With the Summer'13 release, Visier delivers key benefits:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>External Data Syndication and Benchmarks:</strong> seamless integration of external data and benchmarks power the exploration of key labor market statistics, and enable compare and contrast analysis of internal data to external data across such topics as diversity, employment costs and the labor market.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Recruitment Pipeline and Effectiveness Analysis:</strong> pre-built best-practice analysis of the full lifecycle of recruiting allows organization to:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Improve recruiting effectiveness through deep candidate and talent pipeline analysis</li>\n \t<li>Understand hiring efficiency and effectiveness across recruiters and sources</li>\n \t<li>Analysis costs for hiring, and measure budgets against open and filled positions</li>\n \t<li>Explore the effectiveness of the offer and acceptance process</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li><strong>Comparative Analysis: </strong>visually explore comparisons through in-depth analysis, and highlight key comparisons through goal settings in dashboards. Visually explore progress to goals with a dynamic thermometer visualization, and set targets relative to previous performance, as a comparison to peers, against overall company performance, or against external data.</li>\n</ul>\n\"HR continues to be under-served by IT in enabling workforce analytics; with our new release, Visier has accomplished what to date has not been possible in the HR organization: integrate key HR Big Data sources for comparative analysis in order to make critical and informed workforce decisions,\" according to John Schwarz, Co-Founder and CEO of Visier. \"Visier delivers best-practice analytics to the business, and with our benchmarking analysis technology, we remove from the business user the burden of integrating and making use of Big Data to answer the most pressing questions.\"\n\nSince its founding in 2010, Visier has redefined how enterprise organizations approach workforce analytics by delivering out-of-the-box HR analytics as a cloud-based service that combines the sophistication of predictive capabilities with the ease-of-use of consumer applications. Visier's Workforce Analytic solution delivers instant in-depth insight into an organization's workforce, by asking and answering the most profound and impactful workforce questions. Information is represented with dynamic visualizations, making it easy for HR professionals and business leaders to see the connections buried in the data and gain immediate insight allowing them to align and optimize their people strategy to meet their business objectives.\n\nThe power of workforce analytics does not come from automating processes but from finding an insight in the data captured during day-to-day workflow, making a connection, and therefore enabling impactful and measurable changes to an organization's workforce. Making the right decisions and taking the right corrective action delivers to the business benefits that will sustain performance, productivity, profitability and a competitive advantage. Visier is a proud recipient of Human Resources Executive's Top HR Product for 2012, and was named an \"Awesome New Technology\" at the 15th Annual HR Technology show. Visier was also recognized in Gartner's \"Cool Vendor\" in Human Capital Management Software 2012 Report.\n\nVisier is recognized for building analytic solutions that are intuitive, integrated, innovative and delivers immediately tangible business value to organizations.

      "Visier Releases Survey Report that Identifies Workforce Analytics and Planning Trends for 2013",
    Content:
      '<h2>Market survey shows that purpose-built solutions have the highest levels of satisfaction, and that there is a clear trend for increasing investment in workforce analytics</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC</strong> Visier, the innovation leader in workforce analytics, released today a 2013 Survey of Employers: "The State of Workforce Analytics and Planning: Practices, Preferences &amp; Plans," indicating that workforce analytics and workforce planning remain critical topics in many organizations. There is a clearly recognized need to further invest in and improve the use of historical and predictive data to assist the HR function to move to a point where decisions and guidance on people, who represent the most critical asset in the organization, are made less based on intuition and more on statistically sound facts.\n\nVisier commissioned Fisher Vista (HRmarketer) to survey over 400 U.S.-based employers regarding their workforce analytics and planning practices, preferences and future plans. The 2013 Survey of Employers continues the exploration of how North American organizations are solving the challenges of delivering insights about the workforce, and which areas of the workforce domain they are seeking to measure and understand the most. In addition, this year\'s survey addresses the topic of workforce planning. With workforce analytics and planning being complementary processes in the pursuit of a more optimized workforce, the relationship of these two areas provides a helpful insight.\n\nHighlights from the 2013 Survey Results include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>More than 37% of companies do not have a system in place to manage and report metrics on their workforce.</li>\n \t<li>Despite their inherent shortcomings and pitfalls, more than a third of respondents still use spreadsheets to manage and report workforce metrics.</li>\n \t<li>Purpose-built workforce analytics solutions had 85% satisfaction rates, while spreadsheets, similar to the 2012 survey findings, had the highest reported levels of dissatisfaction with 59% reporting being dissatisfied.</li>\n \t<li>31% continue to say they would benefit from easier-to-use analytics tools; 31% felt they would benefit from an improved ability to interpret and present workforce data, as compared to 23% in 2012.</li>\n \t<li>Over 52% of participants will increase their investment in workforce analytics within next 12 months, as compared to 36% in 2012.</li>\n</ul>\nThere is clear evidence that when integrated with business analytics, workforce analytics improve an organization\'s human capital performance and increase its ROI. Analytics is the critical factor that allows organizations to make decisions that are responsive and ready to meet the ever-increasing challenges in the marketplace.\n\n"This is the second consecutive year the survey indicates that organizations are aware of the value of purpose-built solutions for workforce analytics as measured in ROI on human capital and in user satisfaction," according to John Schwarz, Founder and CEO of Visier. "Equally important, the survey shows that enterprises are planning to adopt a more sophisticated tool for workforce planning to assist with the response to insights discovered in the analysis process. For those organizations still trying to make do with spreadsheets, the results are particularly stark and the call to action clear - move to \'best-practice\' analytic solutions."<a href="http://info.visier.com/2013-workforce-analytics-and-planning-survey-report?utm_campaign=HRM+2013+Survey+Report+PR+2013&amp;utm_source=Online" rel="nofollow">\n</a>\n<h4><strong style="line-height: 1.125em;">About Visier</strong></h4>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      'Visier Inc., Named "Cool Vendor" in Human Capital Management Software 2012 Report',
    Content:
      '<h2>Vendors Selected for the "Cool Vendor" Report Are Innovative, Impactful and Intriguing</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC -</strong> Visier Inc., the innovation leader in delivering workforce analytics through the cloud, today announced that the company has been included in the list of "Cool Vendors" in Human Capital Management Software, 2012 report by Gartner, Inc.\n\nGartner\'s Cool Vendors in human capital management (HCM) software for 2012 help organizations throughout the full employee life cycle, from workforce planning to separation.\n\nAccording to Gartner, many organizations have traditionally underinvested in workforce analytics, but they have seen a strong interest starting to build over the last two years and expect to see this trend continue.\n\nMany organizations believe in the power and importance of managing and reporting workforce analytics but a significant amount of organizations are still figuring out how best to access and measure the data more effectively. One problem that often stands in their way, especially when organizations use multiple, disparate HR systems to track HR data, is that they cannot get a unified and comprehensive 360 degree view of their <em>true </em>workforce data, which is necessary to create a people strategy to increase the ROI of their human capital.\n\nVisier Workforce Analytics is an end-to-end, cloud-based application designed to easily identify the key insights necessary to improve the ROI of an organization\'s human capital. Visier Workforce Analytics is a powerful, intuitive and interactive solution that uncovers deep insight into the core metrics of your workforce, by answering the most critical and fundamental questions companies have about their workforce, and more importantly, with predictive <em>what-if</em> analysis helps to predict and plan for their future needs.\n\n"We believe our inclusion in the Cool Vendor report by Gartner is further recognition that our mission to empower organizations with the most critical and deepest insights, in order to optimize their people strategy to meet their business strategy, is resonating with both customers and industry influencers," according to John Schwarz, Founder and CEO of Visier. "Organizations are realizing that their business strategy cannot be implemented without a supporting people strategy. Traditional human capital management approaches have not provided the necessary insight and analytics to create an effective people strategy. With Visier Workforce Analytics, organizations finally have the solution they need to turn insight into action."\n<h4><strong>About the Cool Vendors</strong></h4>\nGartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings.

    Content:
      '<strong>VANCOUVER, BC</strong> - Visier Inc., an innovation leader in delivering workforce analytics through the cloud, today was named one of Canada\'s "Top 25 Up And Comers" in the 2012 Edition of the Branham300. The 25 companies in this category are selected based on creativity and innovation, whether in a new technology area, or optimizing existing technology in an innovative manner.\n\nThe Branham300 is the most comprehensive listing of the top publicly traded and privately held organizations operating in the Canadian Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry.\n\n"With the lingering effects of the economic downturn all but gone in 2011, the Canadian ICT industry generated impressive growth over the past year in order to set a new Branham300 revenue record," said Wayne Gudbranson, President and CEO of Branham Group. "Canada\'s largest tech players as well as companies within the SMB segment closed strong fiscal 2011 campaigns, an indication that companies of all sizes experienced the market rebound. Looking forward, Branham expects the industry to build on its 2011 performance and post strong single-digit growth in 2012."\n\nFounded in 2010 by business intelligence experts, including former Business Objects CEO, John Schwarz, the leadership team has a proven track record of technical, operational and strategic management success with companies including Business Objects, Crystal Decisions, SAP, IBM and Symantec. Visier was founded on the notion that traditional analytic approaches are too costly, and prone to failure. Visier pioneered a new solution centric approach - analytic applications - that starts with the most important business insights an organization needs. Through in-memory technology to incorporate any data, and a highly visual and intuitive interface organizations can finally bring analytics to the entire organization.\n\nVisier\'s first analytic application is designed to empower HR professionals with the most critical insights they need. HR organizations have always understood that people are the most important and complex asset in the company. Until now, they have lacked the solutions to provide the necessary insights to optimize their people strategy to meet their business strategy.\n\n"2011 was a breakout year for Visier and to be named to Canada\'s Top 25 Up &amp; Comers list is a testament to all the hard work and innovative thinking of the entire Visier team, as well it also validates our place in the market," said John Schwarz, Founder and CEO of Visier, adding, "we are very proud to be recognized, amongst the best of the best in Canadian information technology."\n\nThe Branham300 2012 results are also published on the Branham300 website, as well as in the April/May edition of Backbone Magazine, circulated in the Globe &amp; Mail.\n<h4><strong>About Branham300</strong></h4>\nFor nearly 20 years, the Branham300 has highlighted the top Canadian and Multinational ICT companies operating in Canada, as ranked by revenues. It illustrates the depth and breadth of innovative technologies developed in Canada and is widely considered to be a leading source of intelligence on Canada\'s ICT industry.\n\n<strong style="line-height: 1.125em;">About Visier</strong>\n\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

Spreadsheets and single-source solutions built into existing applications remain prevalent, with ease-of-use the improvement, most likely to improve success in workforce analytics.\n\nClearly, the survey indicates that there is an acceptance of using workforce analytics in organizations to manage and report HR data. However, the survey also revealed that there is room for greater improvements in the solutions they are selecting to use, to manage and report their workforce analytics.\n\nWhen asked what would most aid their success, 30% of participants said they would benefit from "easier-to-use" analytics tools, and 23% felt they would benefit from an improved ability to interpret and present workforce data.\n\n"This survey highlights the still tremendous opportunity for customers to improve the effectiveness of their most expensive asset - their people. 90% of respondents claim to be using spreadsheets for some or most of their workforce analysis," according to John Schwarz, Founder and CEO of Visier. "Spreadsheets are subject to poor quality data, loss of version control and inconsistent interpretation. Well-designed workforce analytics provide reliable and consistent answers to business questions; companies that adopt such solutions are proven to outperform those that don\\\'t. Our advice is to take the plunge - find out what is really happening with your people!"\n\nIn February of 2012, HRmarketer Services Group surveyed over 150 U.S.-based employers regarding their workforce analytics practices, preferences and future plans. The respondents that participated in the survey represented a wide variety of organizations that use workforce analytics to varying degrees. These organizations ranged in size from less than 1,000 employees to organizations with well over 10,000 employees. The majority of the participants worked in an HR role, although a small demographic represented senior management, and other departmental groups such as IT and Finance.

The new releases continue Visier’s tradition of high velocity innovation in workforce analytics and planning.\n\nVisier Workforce Analytics is a cloud solution that is pre-built with HR industry expertise and best practices. Implemented in just four to eight weeks, Visier unifies an organization’s workforce data from unlimited sources, and provides answers “out of the box” to hundreds of workforce questions. From simple metrics, like headcount, to complex predictive analytics, like which high-value employees are likely to leave, Visier provides actionable insights on demand.\n\n“The Spring release of Visier Workforce Analytics continues our mission to enable the most extensive on-demand workforce analytics capabilities in the industry,” says Ian Cook, Director, Product Management, Workforce Analytics, Visier. “Our customers are now not only able to slice and dice their analysis populations by limitless dimensions, but they can also filter and dig into their analysis population on the fly when presenting insights to business leaders.”\n\nVisier Workforce Analytics Spring 2014 also includes over seventy new metrics, supporting an extensive new Total Cost of Workforce model. Customers are able to analyse their budgeted and actual workforce costs on demand, to a degree of detail that without Visier would be incredibly difficult or impossible to attain.\n\nVisier Workforce Planning is a cloud solution that lets organizations eliminate the administrative pain and complexity of operational workforce planning. A pioneering solution, Visier Workforce Planning turns planning into an automated, collaborative process, where Finance and HR connect seamlessly, and decisions are made based on accurate, up-to-date insights into workforce data and trends.\n\n“Workforce analytics and workforce planning are inherently linked together,” says Dino Zincarini, Director, Product Management, Workforce Planning, Visier. “Workforce analytics is about making decisions based on what has happened to your workforce. Workforce planning is about turning those decisions into actions to create a better future. With the Spring release we have added more capabilities to monitor your actuals against plan and deeper understand the costs associated with plans. We have also enabled further automation around planning scenarios and collaboration.”\n\nVisier delivers new product releases each quarter.

(EA), has joined Visier’s Board of Directors. Toledano will guide Visier as it broadens adoption of its Applied Big Data solutions for workforce insight and action.\n\n“We are honored to have Gabrielle join our board. Some of the world’s most highly respected and influential HR leaders have benefited from her tutelage,” says John Schwarz, Visier CEO and Founder. “Her strategic leadership and mentoring capabilities will be an asset for Visier as we expand our user base within the talent management market.”\n\nA 25-year HR professional, Toledano is responsible for overseeing workforce development strategies on a global scale at EA.

(To learn about Toledano’s leadership tips, read her <a href="/blog/five-traits-of-highly-respected-hr-leaders/">Five Traits of Highly Respected HR Leaders</a> blog post.)\n\nTwo senior HR leaders who have reported to Toledano at Electronic Arts include Steve Cadigan, who became the VP of Talent for LinkedIn, and Jeff Ryan, who became the SVP of HR for CBS Interactive, and is now the VP of People for GoPro.\n\n“Gabrielle is a great leader who sets a high bar for herself and others,” says Cadigan, who is currently the founder of Cadigan Talent Ventures. “She’s a grounded leader who has a real knack for putting the right people in the right roles. I have yet to find another HR leader who has groomed more executive HR talent than she has.”\n\n"Gabrielle is a courageous HR exec, who sets a good example for her direct reports by taking on tough challenges. Everyone -- from junior reports to senior executives -- respects the fact that she speaks her mind, has high integrity, and effectively balances the employee experience with the needs of the business,” says Ryan.\n\nPrior to joining EA, Toledano held a number of senior HR roles at technology companies, including Siebel Systems, Microsoft, and Oracle. Toledano received her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Stanford University, followed by a Rotary Scholarship assignment in Santiago, Chile. She has served on the Board of Directors of the Society of Human Resources Management (SHRM).\n\n“The most rewarding aspect of my career has been to empower talented HR professionals to move into more strategic roles,” says Toledano. “I am looking forward to working with Visier, helping the company provide HR professionals with the data they need to deliver objective points of view that are linked to business needs.”\n\nWith Visier, HR and other business professionals can leverage data from unlimited sources to make fact-based decisions.

      "Human Resources Joins the Analytics Revolution, Harvard Business Review Analytic Services Report Finds",
    Content:
      '<h2><i>Executives are embracing workforce analytics as an essential strategy to directly impact financial results, according to Visier-sponsored report</i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nVANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA -- A growing number of corporate boards, CEOs, and CHROs are looking to apply data-driven solutions to improve decisions about talent, and drive revenues and profit, according to a recent report by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services (HBR-AS) sponsored by Visier, the innovation leader in workforce analytics and planning.\n\nThe report, <i>HR Joins the Analytics Revolution, </i>finds that corporate leaders are embracing workforce analytics as an essential strategy that can directly impact financial results. However, HR has a ways to go: only 24 percent surveyed by HBR-AS currently analyze their workforce -- the remaining 76 percent use data either rarely, on a reactive basis, or for operational reporting.\n\n<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6055" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hbr-analytics3.0-screen.png" alt="hbr-analytics3.0-screen" width="187" height="244" />“At a time when talent has never been more critical to business performance, it’s no wonder that executives and leaders are craving the ability to identify future talent gaps and other pending workforce trends,” says Alex Clemente, managing director of HBR Analytic Services. “But according to industry analysts, it can take up to 10 years to get this level of analytics maturity using traditional methods. Businesses need to find innovative solutions to get the insights they need in a timely fashion, or risk losing out to the competition.”\n\nIn its most recent annual survey of U.S. CEOs, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) found more than 80 percent of respondents said that they needed talent-related insights to make business decisions. Nearly half (48%) of the HBR Analytic Services survey respondents said they expect to have predictive analytics based on HR data and data from other sources within or outside the organization in use within two years.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhile many business leaders aspire to move up the analytics maturity curve, the report reveals that the top three barriers to achieving better use of data, metrics, and predictive analysis are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>inaccurate, inconsistent, or hard-to-access data requiring too much manual manipulation</li>\n \t<li>lack of analytic acumen or skills among HR professionals</li>\n \t<li>lack of adequate investment in necessary HR/talent analytical systems</li>\n</ul>\n“It’s clear that bad data, lack of analytic skills, long implementation times and high costs have been getting in the way of HR adopting workforce analytics. At Visier, we have directly addressed these challenges by reinventing how analytics is done. By delivering a pre-built workforce analytics and planning solution in the cloud based on industry best practices -- and by designing it for virtually instant self-service use by HR and business leaders -- we are proud to be fueling the HR analytics revolution ,” says John Schwarz, Co-Founder and CEO of Visier.\n\nAn <a href="https://www.visier.com/blog/ultimate-big-data-cheat-sheet/">Applied Big Data solution</a>, Visier implements its cloud solutions in four to eight weeks, bringing together all of its customer’s workforce data -- from unlimited sources -- to predict how workforce behaviors (such as future employee recruitment, promotion, and turnover patterns) will change.

      "Visier Predicts Top Recruitment, Retention, and Compensation Trends for 2015",
    Content:
      '<h2><i>People Analytics Becomes Critical to Organizations As Economic Outlook Improves</i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nLas Vegas, NV – Visier, the innovation leader in People Analytics, today announced its predictions on workforce trends in 2015. As the economy continues to improve, the global competition for talent is heightening. Voluntary resignations in the U.S. are now at a five-year high. The number of new hires has almost reached pre-recession levels, and the unemployment rate, as reported by the Labor Department last week, has fallen to the lowest level since July 2008.\n\nWith the economy moving in a positive direction, key challenges are emerging around <a href="/blog/people-analytics-ends-employee-retention-guesswork/">retention</a>, recruiting, <a href="/blog/time-to-know-your-total-cost-of-workforce-tcow/">workforce costs</a>, generational shifts, <a href="/blog/hire-diverse-talent-workforce-analytics/">diversity</a>, and the role of HR. Organizations will increasingly seek People Analytics solutions to overcome these challenges.\n\n“Modern day boards and CEOs understand that data-driven solutions can improve decisions about talent, and, as a result, revenues and profits,” says John Schwarz, CEO and Co-Founder of Visier. “The consequence is that companies must focus on the use of data-driven insights to develop actionable plans to better recruit, retain and motivate employees.”\n\nMarket demand for People Analytics is on the rise as business leaders increasingly recognize that recruiting, retaining, and motivating the right talent is critical to business growth and prosperity. Equally important is the ability to <a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/ceo-survey/2012/key-findings/hr-talent-strategies.jhtml">access and analyze the right information</a> to support talent-related business decisions.\n\nVisier announced its predictions on top HR trends in 2015 at the <a href="http://www.hrtechconference.com/">HR Technology Conference</a> in Las Vegas on October 7-10, 2014.\n<h3>1. <b>Companies will double-down on retention and recruiting</b></h3>\nIn the improving economy, retention challenges will arise as workers become more confident in exploring new jobs. At the same time -- as unemployment drops -- there will be increased competition for recruiting talent and vacancy rates will increase.\n\n<b style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Solution: </b><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Organizations will look beyond recruiting processes to leveraging People Analytics to improve hiring outcomes. People Analytics provides actionable insights, such as identifying top performers who are at risk of leaving; providing visibility into how compensation, performance, and engagement impact retention; and discovering which recruiting sources deliver the most top performers. With People Analytics, HR will shift from reacting to hiring demands to proactively planning the workforce. HR will identify critical resources, forecast turnover, and develop more accurate hiring plans based on delivering talent for critical business strategies.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>2. <b>Organizations will move their focus from headcount to total workforce costs</b></h3>\nWhether it is new workforce strategies that rely more on contingent workers, or legislation such as the Affordable Care Act that impacts spend on benefits, organizations will increasingly seek to understand the complete picture of workforce costs. Insights into salary or direct compensation only tell part of the workforce cost story, and to understand the real impact to the business organizations will expand their analysis to the total cost of the workforce.\n\n<b style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Solution:</b><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"> With People Analytics solutions connecting data from all HR systems, HR will be in a position to provide an accurate and up to date view into the Total Cost of Workforce. Organizations looking to optimize spending will perform more accurate, scenario-based workforce planning, and make decisions based on their actual Total Costs rather than simply looking at headcount.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>3. <b>Generational shifts will be an increasingly hot topic</b></h3>\nThe U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by 2015 millennials will overtake the majority representation of the workforce, as baby boomers retire in greater and greater numbers. Millennials are known to have significantly different expectations for their employment experience. HR will face challenges of engaging and retaining newly hired millennials, while also ensuring the knowledge and skills of retiring baby boomers are maintained.\n\n<b>Solution: </b>People Analytics will help organizations predict and better time retirements, and identify critical skills being lost, while also enabling them to understand how to best motivate, train, and retain millennial workers.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>4. <b>Depth of insight into diversity will become more valued</b></h3>\nWith major companies publicly sharing their workforce diversity shortfalls in 2014, more organizations will feel the pressure to reveal workforce diversity figures in 2015, and ensure their organization looks like their customers.\n\n<b style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Solution: </b><span style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Empirical studies have shown that diverse organizations perform better than organizations that are largely homogeneous. People Analytics will play an important role in putting theory and ideas into action, enabling organizations to analyze diversity across topic areas such as recruitment, succession, promotions, and turnover, and understand how they compare against industry benchmarks.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3>5. <b>From analyzing the past, to planning and predicting the future</b></h3>\nWith a growing economy comes heightened competition which drives the need for more agile business strategies to take advantage of newfound opportunity - before the competition catches up. Reacting to past trends will not give the business the insight necessary to align and act. HR will look to more sophisticated workforce plans that incorporate data projections and increase workforce decision agility.\n\n<b style="line-height: 1.428571429;">Solution: </b>People Analytics<span style="line-height: 1.428571429;"> will deliver insight from analyzing the workforce and allow HR leaders to align the business on the necessary action to deliver on the business strategy. HR organizations will implement regular forecasting to ensure plans remain on track, that the business can react to changing needs, and that the business strategy is on track in people resources and costs.</span>\n\nSchwarz says, “As we look towards 2015, we see broad management use of workforce data becoming a strong trend, with more and more companies making investments in workforce intelligence. Many of the HR challenges we anticipate can be overcome with a wide deployment of People Analytics. Our experience is that Applied Big Data solutions like ours make it possible for HR departments to easily, affordably and quickly gain access to actionable insights, and to use this knowledge to develop more optimal workforce plans.”\n<h4><b>About Visier</b></h4>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      '<h2><i>Visier’s FALL 2014 product releases continue to expand and deepen Visier content and capabilities in both workforce analytics and workforce planning</i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</b> -- Visier, the innovation leader in Workforce Intelligence, today announced the FALL 2014 releases of <a href="https://www.visier.com/solutions/talent/">Visier Workforce Analytics</a> and <a href="https://www.visier.com/solutions/planning/">Visier Workforce Planning</a>. The new releases continue to expand and deepen the scope of Visier’s analytic content and capabilities, while providing even more powerful workforce planning functionality and insights.\n\n“One of Visier’s unique differentiators is our ability to provide customers with new, multi-dimensional insights by connecting all of their workforce data together, from all their HR and business systems,” says Ian Cook, Director, Product Management, Workforce Analytics, Visier. “With this release, we’ve continued to expand and deepen the scope of these insights to include even more recognition and succession planning metrics, analytics and interactive visualizations.”\n\nWith the FALL 2014 release, Visier Workforce Analytics now includes a set of recognition metrics, analytics and visualizations, which organizations can use to better understand and make decisions about the impact of their recognition programs. Because Visier brings together all of an organization’s workforce data, organizations can see how their recognition programs are impacting employee retention, performance and other factors.\n\nAdditionally, Visier has added new succession planning content, and developed a one-of-a-kind interactive talent flow visualization. This visualization -- which is enabled by Visier’s unique multi-dimensional data structure and in-memory technology that is 250,000 times faster than traditional approaches -- enables organizations to analyze in real time how people have developed in their careers and moved over time. For example, Visier customers can trace career paths for critical roles, uncover the lineage of leaders, and see how departments have developed over time.\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Flow-Visual.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9569" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Flow-Visual.png" alt="Flow Visual" width="1197" height="584" /></a>\n\n<em>Visier’s talent flow visualization lets customers trace career paths for critical roles, uncover the lineage of leaders, and see how departments have developed over time.</em>\n\nVisier Workforce Analytics is designed to facilitate intuitive, time-sensitive storytelling with data.

This is critical to accurate, data-driven planning.”\n\nWith Visier Workforce Planning, organizations can set goals for the fiscal year, or for the length of the plan, and then monitor how they are performing compared to these goals throughout the year.\n\nVisier delivers new product releases each quarter.

      '<h2><em>Visier Customer Fosters a Data-Driven HR Culture With On-Demand Analytics</em></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nVANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA - Visier, the innovation leader in Workforce Intelligence, today announced that one of its customers, Micron Technology, Inc., has earned a Brandon Hall Group 2014 Excellence in Technology Award for fuelling HR transformation with on-demand, self-service analytics. (To view a complete list of the winners, click <a title="Brandon Hall 2014 Award Winners" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbrandonhall.com%2Fexcellence-technology.php%3Fyear%3D2014&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFk0IuaegSkUsjgu9fHzv_qQjdHmw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.)\n\n“Our world is more complex now. People decisions must be guided by data,” says Tim Long, Director of Workforce Information, Micron. “In our experience, the reason data is less often used for people decisions is that it takes too long to prepare and access. With self-service analytics, our HR team can focus more on business questions and answers and less time on preparing and processing the data in between.”\n\nSince implementing Visier Workforce Analytics in late 2013, as part of its broader data-driven HR strategy, Micron’s Workforce Information team has rolled out self-service analytics to more than 150 HR leaders and business partners and more than 800 business area managers globally. As a result, Micron is uncovering new workforce insights that can be used to make decisions that are closely linked to business performance.\n\n“We are very proud of Micron’s Workforce Information team for their success in moving up the workforce analytics maturity curve,” says John Schwarz, CEO and Co-Founder, Visier. “They are leading the pack in data-driven HR, helping intuition-based professionals tell stories with data so they can drive talent strategies that are linked to business results.”\n\nA panel of veteran, independent senior industry experts, and Brandon Hall Group senior analysts and executives evaluated the award entries based upon innovation, value proposition and measurable results.\n\nVisier Workforce Analytics is part of a new solution category called Workforce Intelligence. With Workforce Intelligence, companies can fuel HR transformation initiatives, created to directly link the people strategy with revenue, profit, and stock value.

      '<h2><i>Leading Analyst Firm Lauds Visier for Workforce Management Technology Excellence</i></h2>\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA </b>- Visier, the innovation leader in Workforce Intelligence, today announced that it has won a Brandon Hall Group gold award in the Best Advance in Unique HR or Workforce Management Technology category. The award recognizes Visier for enabling businesses to understand their total cost of workforce with its Workforce Planning solution. (To view a complete list of the winners, click <a href="http://brandonhall.com/excellence-technology.php?year=2014">here</a>.)\n\n“It is very gratifying to be recognized for our contribution to helping organizations turn workforce planning into a continuous, accurate, and streamlined process that delivers real bottom line results,” says John Schwarz, CEO and Founder, Visier. “Having an accurate picture of the complete organization and total cost of the workforce is critical to effective business planning -- yet most organizations today create workforce plans with an extremely inaccurate and limited view of their future people needs and costs. Visier Workforce Planning is a pioneering solution that will for the first time enable HR to input an accurate picture into the Enterprise Resource Planning process.”\n\nVisier Workforce Planning is part of a new solution category called Workforce Intelligence. With Workforce Intelligence, companies can fuel HR transformation initiatives, created to directly link the people strategy with revenue, profit, and market capital value.\n\nImproving the quality of workforce planning can result in significant bottom line savings for organizations. For Fortune 2000 companies, even a small improvement in the accuracy of workforce planning can translate into millions of dollars in savings.\n\nVisier Workforce Planning is based on the foundation of Visier Workforce Analytics, enabling organizations to develop workforce plans based on the insights they gain from their analytics. As a result of this connection, organizations are able to develop plans using current, accurate workforce data, and monitor actuals against plans over time. Once an organization has launched Visier Workforce Analytics, typically implemented in 4-8 weeks, it can then immediately “turn on” Visier Workforce Planning and start realizing its benefits.\n\n“HCM technology is a major enabler of business growth and our Excellence in Technology award winners epitomize the vision, creativity and resourcefulness that drive results. We are honored to recognize these excellent organizations,” said Mike Cooke, Chief Executive Officer of Brandon Hall Group.\n\nRachel Cooke, Chief Operating Office of Brandon Hall Group who runs the awards program, stated, "The award-winning initiatives and the skill and strategy that went into them is inspiring. The innovation represented by these winners can serve as models for success for many others that strive to push their organizations to the next level.”\n\nA panel of veteran, independent senior industry experts, and Brandon Hall Group senior analysts and executives evaluated the entries based upon the following criteria:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Product: What was the product’s breakthrough innovation?</li>\n \t<li>Unique differentiators: What makes the product unique and how does it differ from any competing products?</li>\n \t<li>Value proposition: What problem does the product solve and/or what need does this product address?</li>\n \t<li>Measurable results: What are the benefits customers can expect to experience as a result of using this product?</li>\n</ul>\nFor more information, <a title="Request a Demo" href="/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact Visier</a>.\nFollow Visier on Twitter <a title="Twitter @VisierAnalytics" href="https://twitter.com/visier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Visier</a>\nLike Visier on <a title="Facebook Visier Analytics page" href="https://www.facebook.com/Visier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>\n<h4><b>About Brandon Hall Group, Inc.</b></h4>\nWith more than 10,000 clients globally and 20 years of delivering world class research and advisory services, Brandon Hall Group is the most well-known and established research organization in the performance improvement industry.

      "ConAgra Foods Drives HR Transformation With Big Data Analytics, New Study Shows",
    Content:
      '<h2><i>Bersin by Deloitte, Deloitte Consulting LLP Case Study Reveals How 2012 Expansion Plans Prompted Food Maker to Implement Visier Analytics-Driven Workforce Planning</i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</b> -- Visier, the innovation leader in Workforce Intelligence, today announced the findings of a new Bersin by Deloitte, Deloitte Consulting LLP case study, which reveals how Fortune 250 company ConAgra Foods is using analytics-driven workforce planning to gain a full view of total workforce costs. Entitled, “Continuous, Cost-Driven Workforce Planning: ConAgra Foods Transforms the Role of HR through Analytics,” the study looks at how the company’s acquisition of a private label business spurred the food maker to adopt Visier’s Workforce Intelligence Solutions. \n\n“With Visier’s solutions for workforce analytics and planning we are able to look across our organization in ways that were not possible before, and increasingly enable HR practitioners and business leaders to make workforce decisions based on hard data,” explains Tim Sasek, Manager, People Insights, ConAgra Foods. “We have also been able to broaden the focus of HR beyond people performance and basic HR metrics to include people costs. We have transformed workforce planning from an annual, headcount-focused process into a continuous, cost-focused process that is founded in analytics, based on a broader view of workforce costs.”\n\nAfter ConAgra Foods announced its intent to acquire a private label in 2012, which would increase the size of its workforce by more than 40 percent, the company’s People Insights team sought a new way to calculate the total cost of its workforce and perform workforce planning: At that time, information was spread across the organization in siloed systems within various departments and was often difficult to aggregate and reconcile. The People Insights team had many goals, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Providing a broad base of HR, finance, and other users with easy access to workforce analytics</li>\n \t<li>Optimizing personnel cost planning, forecasting, and analysis with leading technology and processes</li>\n \t<li>Creating real-time visibility for all personnel related costs</li>\n</ul>\nTo address these areas, ConAgra Foods partnered with Visier to aggregate all of the company’s data from multiple systems. The Visier solution provided a self-service analytics resource for HR, finance and operations and other parties to not only glean insights about its workforce, but enable a new paradigm of continuous, data-driven workforce planning focused more on workforce costs and less about total headcount.\n\n“Such self-service analytics solutions enable large organizations to gain real-time insights into employee data, and provide views into their workforces across a wide range of subject areas,” said Karen O’Leonard, VP, Benchmarking and Analytics Research, Bersin by Deloitte, Deloitte Consulting.\n\n“We are enabling HR -- for the first time -- to input an accurate and complete picture of current and future workforce headcount and costs into the Enterprise Resource Planning process. This is a critical capability to support HR playing a stronger leadership role in the business,” says John Schwarz, CEO and Founder, Visier.\n\nVisier delivers Workforce Intelligence solutions that provide the foundation for HR Transformation. Delivered in the cloud, Visier solutions are enabling a rapidly growing number of the world’s best brands understand, prioritize, and plan -- with precision -- how to best and most cost-effectively recruit, retain, develop, and drive productivity from their workforces.\n\nFollow Visier on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/visier">@Visier</a>\n\nLike Visier on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Visier/">Facebook</a>\n<h3><b>About Visier</b></h3>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      '<h2>Visier also launches online community to all Visier product users, providing an exclusive collaboration forum for workforce analytics and planning</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nVANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA -- Visier, the innovation leader in Workforce Intelligence, today announced the WINTER 2015 releases of Visier Workforce Analytics and Visier Workforce Planning. The new releases focus on expanding the value of workforce analytics and planning to people managers enterprise-wide, driving greater business outcomes.\n\n“One of the key market gaps filled by Visier Workforce Planning is the ability for organizations to perform truly collaborative workforce planning that includes meaningful input from leaders on the frontlines of the business,” says Dino Zincarini, Director, Product Management, Workforce Planning, Visier. “With the WINTER 2015 release we have made it easier than ever before for HR to manage and streamline a planning process that includes line of business contributors across the enterprise. The result is not just a better process, but a better plan. A plan that is more aligned with the business strategy and drives greater business outcomes.”\n\nUsing Visier Workforce Planning, lead planners can assign plan segments to line of business managers, and can monitor the activity of these contributors. Line of business managers can create sub-plans based on their frontline knowledge of the headcount and roles needed to meet business objectives, while also seeing where headcount needs are above or below budget. When contributors submit their requirements, lead planners can either send the sub-plan back with comments for further refinement, or can automatically roll up the sub-plan into a consolidated plan for the organization. With this release, workforce planners can now monitor the daily activity of plan contributors.\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WFA-Visier-Workforce-Viewer.png">\n</a> <a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WFP-Collaboration-Tracker.png"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-10535" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WFP-Collaboration-Tracker-1024x504.png" alt="WFP - Collaboration Tracker" width="1024" height="504" /></a>\n\n<em>Visier Workforce Planning’s new Collaboration Tracker facilitates the timely creation of workforce plans</em>\n\nVisier Workforce Analytics WINTER 2015 also includes new functionality focused on extending the power of workforce insights beyond the HR analytics group to HR business partners and business managers throughout an organization.\n\n“Visier is dedicated not just to making HR better, but to making the business better,” says Ian Cook, Director, Product Management, Workforce Analytics, Visier. “To achieve this, Visier has made it easy for organizations to arm all their people managers with insights on demand, enabling them to make more informed workforce decisions.”\n\nWith the WINTER 2015 release, Visier Workforce Analytics customers can extend the benefits of analytics to business leaders with the new Visier Workforce Viewer.

      '<h2><em>New Visier Survey Data Reveals Executive Expectations for Today’s Chief Human Resources Officer</em></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</strong> -- The sought-after Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) is a data-driven, strategic leader who demonstrates business savvy, creativity, and innovation. But new Visier survey results reveal where the majority of executives expect to find top CHRO talent -- and it’s not in Human Resources.\n\nA February 2015 study -- conducted by Harris Poll on behalf of Visier -- surveyed 301 corporate executives at companies with revenue of $1 billion or more across America and asked their views on the changing role of HR leadership. The results reveal the key traits of HR leaders who are perceived as integral to business success.\n\nSuccessful CHROs are:\n\n<em>Data-Driven</em>\n<ul>\n \t<li>80% of executives say their company cannot succeed without an assertive, data-driven CHRO, who takes a strong stance on talent issues and uses relevant facts to deliver an informed point of view.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Business-Oriented</em>\n<ul>\n \t<li>81% of executives say that when hiring new senior HR talent they value business acumen more than technical HR skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Performance-Focused</em>\n<ul>\n \t<li>78% of executives say that their company cannot succeed without a CHRO who takes on responsibility for contributing directly to business performance.</li>\n</ul>\nClick here to <a title="Changing Expectations for HR Leadership2015 Executive Survey Results" href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Visier-Executive-Survey-Results-Changing-Expectations-for-HR-Leadership.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download the full survey report</a>.\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/assertive-data-driven.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-11018 aligncenter" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/assertive-data-driven.png" alt="Assertive and Data Driven CHROs" width="600" height="300" /></a>\n\nMany executives believe the best CHROs do not come from the talent function:\n<ul>\n \t<li>63% of all executives say the most effective CHROs come from non-HR backgrounds (in areas such as finance, operations, or legal).</li>\n</ul>\nC-level executives agree more with this statement than those with less senior titles:\n<ul>\n \t<li>79% of executives who have a C-level, president, or chairman job title say the best CHROs come from non-HR backgrounds, compared to 57% of executives with a VP title, and 42% of executives with other titles (such as director and managing director).</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>HR’s Opportunity or Threat?</strong></h3>\n“The workforce in the developed world and China is rapidly aging. New, first-time workers are barely replacing workers who are retiring. In the upcoming 20 years or longer, there will be a grave shortage of skilled workforce everywhere. The world’s economic center of gravity is moving east. Labor costs in emerging economies are increasing. Now more than ever business leaders need strategic insight and the ability to model future outcomes quickly and accurately,” says John Schwarz, CEO and Founder, Visier.\n\n“CEOs want to think of the CHRO the way they think of the CFO. They want a strategic advisor who can speak the language of the business with hard data. But a solid understanding of people dynamics is also key: talent magnets -- companies with strong talent management capabilities -- increase revenues and profits faster,” adds Schwarz.\n\nWith Visier\'s Workforce Intelligence solutions, CHROs and the teams they lead can maximize their business outcomes through their people. With Visier, world-leading companies are able to:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Shape their workforce to meet business priorities</li>\n \t<li>Hire, develop, and retain more top performers for critical roles</li>\n \t<li>Connect talent and financial requirements</li>\n \t<li>See, predict, and optimize all their workforce costs</li>\n</ul>\nFor more survey results and information on how business trends are driving HR to get the business skills executives want, read this blog post: <strong><a title="The HR Leadership Revolution -- Will You Thrive?" href="https://www.visier.com/hr-leadership/hr-leadership-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The HR Leadership Revolution -- Will You Thrive</a></strong>?\n\nFollow #BoldNewHR on Twitter for more survey stats.\n<h3><strong>Survey Methodology</strong></h3>\nHarris Poll conducted the survey online on behalf of Visier within the United States from February 6-25, 2015, among a total of 301 corporate executives at companies with revenue of $1 billion or more.

      '<h2><em>Visier introduces Visier Talent Advisor, putting real-time Big Data analytics into the hands of every HR and people manager</em></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA --</strong> Visier, the innovation leader in Workforce Intelligence, today unveiled Visier™ Talent Advisor, a market-changing new capability that solves the challenge every manager faces in making the right decisions about their talent, providing instant access to relevant, comparative data for meaningful cohort analysis.\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Visier-Talent-Advisor-Comparison.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12170 size-full" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Visier-Talent-Advisor-Comparison.png" alt="Visier Talent Advisor - Comparison" width="983" height="630" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Visier Talent Advisor enables meaningful, real-time cohort analysis</em></p>\nVisier Talent Advisor, which is included in the <a href="/press-release/product-update-spring-2015/">SPRING 2015 quarterly release of Visier Workforce Analytics</a>, provides data-driven guidance on demand, helping Human Resources (HR) calibrate and partner with people managers to answer common and often costly questions about employees, such as:\n<ul>\n \t<li>A team member has been offered a higher paying position at another company -- should I counteroffer? What should I counteroffer?</li>\n \t<li>I have a new leadership position opening -- who is my best internal candidate?</li>\n \t<li>An employee has asked for a promotion -- should I give one?</li>\n</ul>\nAs outlined in <a href="https://hbr.org/2009/02/why-good-leaders-make-bad-decisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Harvard Business Review article</a>, even good managers make poor decisions. To learn how to help managers make effective decisions using a data-driven approach, read: <a href="/blog/counter-offers-know-when-to-holdem-or-foldem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Counter-Offers: Know When to Hold’em or Fold’em</a>. To understand the science behind faulty decision making, and get tips for adopting a more analytical approach to talent decisions, read the blog post: <a href="/blog/why-experienced-managers-make-bad-talent-decisions/">Why Experienced Managers Make Bad Talent Decisions</a>.\n\n“Every day -- in the absence of accessible data and real-time analysis -- managers make costly, time-sensitive people decisions based on gut feel,” explains Dave Weisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer, Visier. “The result is wasted spending, as well as performance, productivity, and engagement issues. With Visier Talent Advisor we are putting immediate, fact-based answers in the hands of HR and people managers.”\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Why do managers make people decisions based on intuition instead of fact?</strong></h3>\nWhile organizations collect more employee data than ever before, this data is locked in HR management systems that were never designed for analysis. These systems were created to support business processes, such as allowing managers to approve time off, request a new position, or provide performance feedback. Yet business processes are what happens after the people decisions have already been made. Meaningful analysis of employees must be on demand, comparative, and reflect that employees develop and change over time. Meanwhile, “back office” analysis typically takes too long or is based on out-of-date data, and requires data science expertise even large companies often do not have.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Why is Visier Talent Advisor unique?</strong></h3>\nPart of Visier’s <a href="/technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applied Big Data</a> solution for Workforce Analytics, Visier Talent Advisor is designed to guide any HR or people manager to the best decision, regardless of his or her data savvy or analytical acumen.\n\nWith Visier, HR can calibrate people decisions, and people managers can gain meaningful insights into specific employees via relevant, automated comparison cohort analysis. Because Visier connects all of an organization’s workforce data -- from all its disparate HR systems -- Visier can provide a more relevant analysis, taking into account hundreds of employee attributes, related to demographics, performance, compensation, learning and development, recognition, and more.\n\nVisier Talent Advisor will:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Automatically find meaningful cohorts - similar employees or groups of employees for comparison - across employee performance, roles, experience, compensation and others</li>\n \t<li>Highlight the quantified differences between an employee and others or a group</li>\n \t<li>Visualize how an employee compares to others in a group</li>\n</ul>\n“This is just the beginning,” says Weisbeck. “Workforce data is inherently complex and constantly changing -- true Big Data. With Visier Talent Advisor we are pioneering how organizations can leverage this Big Data in a practical and consumable way that enables HR and managers to drive better business outcomes. This includes not only guiding managers to the right decision, but providing data-driven recommendations on the best course of action.”\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Visier-Talent-Advisor-Details.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12169 size-full" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Visier-Talent-Advisor-Details.png" alt="Visier Talent Advisor - Details" width="983" height="630" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Visier is pioneering how organizations can leverage Big Data in a practical way to drive better business outcomes</em></p>\n\n<h4><strong>About Visier</strong></h4>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      '<h2><em>Visier’s SPRING 2015 releases further democratize Big Data analytics and planning</em></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</strong> -- June 22, 2015 - Visier, the innovation leader in Workforce Intelligence, today announced the SPRING 2015 releases of <a href="/solutions/talent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visier Workforce Analytics</a> and <a href="/solutions/planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visier Workforce Planning</a>. The new releases focus on continuing Visier’s mission to make data-driven workforce decision making and planning an accessible and everyday experience for Human Resources (HR) teams and the business leaders and managers they support.\n\n“Core to Visier Workforce Planning is the ability to create different workforce plan scenarios to support better decision making,” says Dave Weisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer, Visier. “With the SPRING 2015 release, Visier customers can automatically generate presentations to share the details of a specific plan scenario, or to compare multiple plan scenarios to each other, allowing HR and business leaders to make more informed decisions.”\n\nFor any workforce plan scenario, stakeholders can easily see:\n<ul>\n \t<li>What is the movement for headcount?</li>\n \t<li>What is the trend for the total cost of workforce?</li>\n \t<li>What is the breakdown for headcount by organization?</li>\n \t<li>What is the breakdown for total cost of workforce by organization per year?</li>\n \t<li>What is the trend for hires and turnover?</li>\n</ul>\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WFP-Release.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12223 size-full" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WFP-Release.png" alt="" width="983" height="650" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Compare different workforce plan scenarios</em></p>\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WFP-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-12194 size-full" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WFP-2.png" alt="Visier Workforce Planning Total cost of workforce" width="983" height="616" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Understand the complete financial impact of your workforce plan</em></p>\nIn addition, Visier Workforce Planning SPRING 2015 includes new capabilities to facilitate multi-dimensional, data-driven planning, allowing workforce planners to easily switch between views. For instance, planners can develop plans based on “measures” such as headcount (taking into account historic trends, planned hires, and projected exits) and cost of workforce (seeing all workforce costs and how they are changing), or by “attributes” (such as department, location, or role).\n\nVisier Workforce Analytics SPRING 2015 also includes functionality to further enable enterprise-wide data-driven decision making, letting HR and people managers answer time-sensitive questions about specific team members without the hours of manual effort otherwise required.\n\n“With the SPRING release of Visier Workforce Analytics we are excited to introduce Visier Talent Advisor, a market-changing new capability that enables real-time comparative, cohort analysis of specific employees,” says Weisbeck. “With Visier, HR and people managers can gain meaningful insights into specific employees via relevant, automated comparisons.

      "Visier’s Predictive Analytics Technology Found to Be Up to 8x More Accurate at Identifying “Resignation Risk” Employees",
    Content:
      '<h2><i>Assessment validates Visier’s patented Continuous Machine Learning approach</i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA, July 16, 2015 --</b> Visier, the innovation leader in Workforce Intelligence, today shared the results of an in-depth validation of its patented <a href="/technology">predictive analytics technology</a>. The assessment found that Visier is up to 8x more accurate at predicting who will resign over the next three months than guesswork or intuition -- and up to 10x more accurate when focused on the top 100 “at risk” employees at a given organization.\n\n“There has been significant hype around predictive workforce analytics, specifically around <a href="/blog/reduce-employee-turnover-with-workforce-analytics/">identifying employees most at risk of exiting an organization</a>,” explains Dave Weisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer, Visier. “The problem is that most ‘at risk’ predictive analytics capabilities available today are too narrowly applied and are in their infancy -- they have simply not been used for long enough by enough companies for enough employees on enough sources of data. Visier’s algorithm, on the other hand, has been making predictions for years, which has given us years of history across multiple customers and industries, and tens of thousand of exit events. The result is an unprecedented ability to validate how accurate the predictions are.”\n\nRead the <a href="/blog/do-predictive-workforce-analytics-actually-work/">blog post</a> to learn more about Visier’s technology and how the accuracy of its predictions was validated.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>Continuous Machine Learning</b></h3>\nVisier applies a <i>Continuous</i> Machine Learning approach. For each customer, Visier’s patented in-memory multidimensional analytics technology looks back over 18 months, at all employees and potentially hundreds of employee variables or attributes, as well as the groupings within each attribute, and determines how much each correlates to the employee resignations that have occurred during that period. Visier then automatically assigns each current employee an “at risk” score, essentially ranking each employee from highest to lowest in resignation risk.\n\nAll of this is calculated dynamically and instantly, so when an HR analyst, business partner, or leader goes into Visier and asks which employees are “at risk” in a specific employee sub-group (for instance, specifying a role, location, tenure, and performance level), Visier automatically provides the relevant results, based on the latest, most current data applicable to the user.\n\nVisier does not artificially limit or restrict what data is analyzed. Rather, Visier always considers all the attributes for the group of employees being looked at. Because Visier analyzes all employee data (from all systems holding employee data), Visier is not limited like HR Management applications, which manage only a portion of the employee lifecycle.\n\nA typical approach by many “at risk” predictors is to perform a regression analysis on a select group of attributes. For instance, a manager thinks salary and tenure have something to do with resignations, so the analyst looks for a correlation between those attributes and resignations to see if the manager is right. They may indeed prove to be right, but in artificially limiting the analysis, several other attributes that relate to resignations may be missed.\n\nMore sophisticated methods train algorithms with various machine learning techniques. However, these methods are also limited: people leave companies for a variety of often surprising reasons and those reasons change over time.\n\n“For the best results,” Weisbeck says, “all potential reasons -- in the form of all employee attributes, across all HR systems -- should be considered, and the results should be calculated <i>continuously</i> to take into account changing conditions. Hence, Visier’s Continuous Machine Learning approach.”\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>HR’s Critical Role</b></h3>\nDespite the hype and Visier’s great results, predictive analytics will not replace human intervention: predictive analytics is about more than <i>who</i> will leave, it is about <i>why</i> they are leaving.\n\nVisier technology performs a unique clustering analysis to generate a Key Drivers analysis, which shows which of the hundreds of employee attributes are most related to an increase or decrease in resignations.\n\n“This sort of prediction is even more valuable than naming individuals,” says Weisbeck. “Identifying the key drivers of resignations allows HR to develop thoughtful, refined, long-term programs to reduce resignation rates by targeting root causes.”\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Driver-Chart.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12416" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blog-post-driver-chart.png" alt="Visier Drivers Chart" width="983" height="544" /></a>\n<h4></h4>\n<h4><b>About Visier</b></h4>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      "Nearly Three-Quarters of Businesses Have Missed Objectives Due to Inadequate Workforce Planning, Harvard Business Review Analytic Services Report Reveals",
    Content:
      '<h2><i>Poor Workforce Planning Leads to Talent Shortfalls and the Inability to Meet Business Goals</i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</b> -- September 21, 2015 - Talent shortfalls have serious implications to business results, and poor workforce planning is a major cause that organizations are struggling to address, according to a new Visier-sponsored report released by Harvard Business Review Analytic Services (HBR-AS).\n\nThe majority of leaders (73 percent) have experienced talent shortfalls leading to missed business objectives as a result of poor workforce planning (the process through which companies align their workforce supply with their business needs), reveals the report, which is based on a survey of 323 corporate executives.\n\nDownload the full report, <a href="https://hello.visier.com/hbr-tackling-talent-strategically-workforce-planning/"><i>Tackling Talent Strategically: Winning With Workforce Planning</i></a>.\n\n“Executives recognize that workforce planning is necessary to secure both the right talent, and the right amount of it, to meet business goals, but our research shows they clearly have a long way to go in making this a reality,” says Alex Clemente, managing director of Harvard Business Review Analytic Services.\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/talent-shortfalls.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13040" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/talent-shortfalls1.png" alt="talent-shortfalls" width="650" height="568" /></a>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><b>Moving Beyond Finance-Driven Headcount Planning</b></h3>\nIn PwC’s most recent <a href="http://download.pwc.com/gx/ceo-survey/index.html">Annual Global CEO Survey</a>, over 70 percent of CEOs identified the “availability of key skills” as one of the top three threats to their companies — an eight-year high for that question. Although business leaders know talent shortfalls prevent their companies from achieving their business goals, the HBR-AS survey reveals that they have not aligned their workforce planning process to manage the issue:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Almost half (44 percent) of respondents consider their workforce plans to be driven by finance and to not take talent availability considerations into account.</li>\n \t<li>Although 72 percent would like to be able to model and compare staffing strategies across locations, teams, seniority, skills and other factors to develop better workforce plans, fewer than one-fourth (22 percent) are able to do so now.</li>\n</ul>\n“For many organizations, workforce planning is a finance-driven process focused primarily on managing headcount within the cost budget. But the budgets created by finance are disconnected from the actual talent needed to execute the business objectives,” says John Schwarz, Co-Founder and CEO of Visier. “Consequently, the important decisions related to recruitment, retention, compensation, and productivity are constrained by budgets that do not reflect the people reality. It is urgent that businesses invest to bridge this critical and potentially fatal gap with a workforce intelligence solution.”\n\nTo improve planning, 57 percent of respondents say they need data on what positions/talent are required to meet business objectives, and 57 percent say they need data on what is happening with talent acquisition and attrition. Companies already have this type of information distributed across business functions and in multiple Human Resource Management systems. With Visier Workforce Intelligence, HR leaders can connect and analyze workforce data — from unlimited sources — to forecast and model trends, such as workforce costs and historic turnover, and then collaborate with business leaders on the scenario that is most optimal.\n\nTo learn more about effective workforce planning, <a href="https://www.visier.com/blog/tackling-talent-strategically-qa-with-hbr-as/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the Q&amp;A</a> between Visier’s John Schwarz and Harvard Business Review Analytic Services (HBR-AS).\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/leaders-lack-information.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13039" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/leaders-lack-information.png" alt="leaders-lack-information" width="647" height="581" /></a>\n\nFind data-driven HR insights and tips at <a href="/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.visier.com/clarity\n</a>Follow Visier on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/visier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Visier</a>\nLike Visier on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Visier">Facebook</a>\n<h4><b>About Visier</b></h4>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      '<h2><em>Applied Big Data Solution Gives 400 of Yahoo’s Leaders and People Managers Insights to Enable the Best Workforce in the Industry</em></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</strong> -- October 15, 2015 -- According to an October 2015 commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Visier, The Total Economic Impact™ of The Visier Workforce Analytics Solution, Yahoo has projected three years of cost savings and benefits totaling $2,575,135 by using Visier Workforce Analytics.\n\nWith the Visier solution, Yahoo -- a company with a strong culture of data-driven decision making and a commitment to ensuring fairness across its workforce -- seeks to more effectively hire, develop, and engage key talent.\n\nWhile the vast majority of Fortune 2000 companies are “<a href="http://dupress.com/articles/people-and-hr-analytics-human-capital-trends-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stuck in neutral</a>” with workforce analytics, or are spending millions of dollars to develop capabilities, Yahoo has adopted Visier, an innovative cloud solution that was up and running with Yahoo’s workforce data in one week. Today Yahoo uses Visier to serve over 400 leaders and people managers with up-to-date workforce insights.\n\nAccording to the commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of Visier, in addition to the cost savings, Yahoo identified the following unquantified benefits of using Visier Workforce Analytics:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Yahoo has been able to use Visier to quickly test assumptions and “bust myths” around employee dynamics.</li>\n \t<li>Yahoo, which has fairness as a guiding principle on which all workforce decisions are made, has experienced more employee equity in administration of HR policies.</li>\n \t<li>Yahoo is better able to meets its goal to pay for performance, a key factor in supporting a top talent workforce.</li>\n</ul>\n“Like most large companies Yahoo’s workforce data is generated by a number of siloed HR management systems that are good at processing transactions, but have limited reporting and -- despite marketing hype -- even poorer analytic capabilities,” says John Schwarz, CEO of Visier. “We created Visier to solve this problem, removing the complexity and barriers to workforce intelligence. We are not selling analytics: we are selling a better understanding of the entire workforce lifecycle, from recruitment to development to engagement to total costs and more, and mapping that understanding directly to business outcomes.”\n\n<a href="http://diginomica.com/2015/10/02/visier-ceo-john-schwarz-on-the-failings-of-big-bi-and-why-hr-analytics-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read a recent interview with Visier CEO John Schwarz on the failings of big BI – and why HR analytics matter.</a>\n\nFind data-driven HR insights and tips at <a href="/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.visier.com/clarity</a>\nFollow Visier on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/visier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Visier</a>\nLike Visier on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Visier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>\n<h4><strong>About Visier</strong></h4>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

Today companies are throwing away their annual surveys in favor of new technology approaches, which create an even greater opportunity and demand for workforce analytics.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Read the blog post, The promise and pain of the employee engagement revolution: </span><a href="/blog/the-employee-engagement-hoax-what-every-hr-professional-needs-to-know/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What every HR professional needs to know.</span></a>\n<h3><b>The changing engagement technology landscape</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s era of Big Data and mobile apps, the engagement technology landscape is being rapidly disrupted by start ups offering solutions for weekly employee “pulse” surveys and continuous 360 degree feedback. These apps overcome a major flaw in traditional annual engagement surveys: they provide companies with an up-to-date measure of engagement and how it is changing. However, they do not solve the ultimate challenge of understanding what actually engages, motivates, and retains an employee.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>Analysis of an engagement survey’s results is not analytics</b></h3>\nThe analysis of engagement survey results does not help an organization uncover employee dynamics or answer why one group is more engaged than another. On the other hand, workforce analytics, when done well, brings together external and internal data from all HR systems -- including the Big Data generated by the many new engagement survey and employee feedback platforms.\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Great workforce analytics looks across all the hundreds of employee attributes to uncover the connections that answer critical why and how questions” explains Weisbeck. “For instance, why does a specific team or role or demographic have an issue with engagement? What is the connection between engagement and retention or employee performance? How can we measure the results of HR programs designed to drive engagement and, ultimately, business outcomes?”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The great irony is that today many large companies spend more money on relatively low value annual engagement surveys than they do on workforce analytics -- yet workforce analytics is a top priority and capability gap, as identified in the </span><a href="http://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/human-capital/articles/introduction-human-capital-trends.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte’s Global Human Capital Trends 2015</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report, and is proven to provide significant business benefits.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>The employee engagement revolution</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the next few years employee engagement will evolve dramatically. In the “war for talent” presented by today’s tight labor market, the companies that win will be those who have moved past collecting masses of data in their HR systems to unlocking it with workforce intelligence.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier delivers new product releases each quarter.

Customers can also consolidate multiple currencies into a single standard currency, presenting a plan that was created based on local currencies in one standard currency.</span>\n\n“In our last release we extended our product capabilities to support large-scale enterprise workforce planning, enabling organizations with tens of thousands of employees and contingent workers to align their talent requirements with the needs of the business,” says Weisbeck.”With the FALL release we continue on this theme, now enabling our customers to create global workforce plans that take into account fluctuations in local currencies wherever they operate.”\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nov-30-product-update-wfp-currencies.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-13991 aligncenter" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nov-30-product-update-wfp-currencies.png" alt="nov-30-product-update-wfp-currencies" width="775" height="470" /></a>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier customers can also now model changes in exchange rates, adding assumption models to workforce plans that take a weaker or stronger currency into account.

On the other, market and regulatory pressures require hospitals to continuously improve patient satisfaction and reduce costs and readmission rates to obtain full value from insurance reimbursements. The biggest factor in both dimensions is the workforce: a highly specialized and very mobile group of skilled caregivers who are constantly in short supply.”</span>\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/resignation-rate.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15095" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Data-visualization-showing-what-employee-attributes-impact-resignation-in-a-healthcare-organization.png" alt="Visier Workforce Intelligence for Healthcare - Resignation Rate" width="634" height="424" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Visier<sup>TM</sup> People Analytics for Healthcare includes workforce analytics and planning capabilities that are purpose-built to meet the specific needs of healthcare providers. </em></p>\n\n<h3><b>The Impact of Healthcare Reform on Healthcare Providers </b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of healthcare reform, healthcare providers are facing new pressures: in just the last few years as many as </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottgottlieb/2015/05/14/how-many-people-has-obamacare-really-insured/#4448ea64777f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">18 million more people have healthcare coverage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

    Content:
      '<h2><em>Visier’s WINTER 2016 product releases include business results, insights on-the-go, and financial plan integration</em></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</strong> - Visier, the leader in Workforce Intelligence, today announced the WINTER 2016 releases of Visier Workforce Analytics and Visier Workforce Planning, delivering first-of-its-kind new functionality to its customers.\n\n“The WINTER 2016 release of Visier Workforce Analytics delivers an unmatched new capability that enables companies to instantly connect workforce metrics to business results,” says Dave Weisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer, Visier. “Understanding what workforce levers to pull to drive business outcomes has long been a central goal of workforce analytics; however, actually connecting workforce metrics to business metrics -- like revenue, profits, or customer satisfaction -- has been impossible for all but a few giant companies with unlimited money and data science expertise. With the WINTER release of Visier, we have made it easy and cost effective for any organization to make these connections.”\n\nLearn more about this industry first capability to directly connect the workforce to business results: <a href="https://www.visier.com/press-release/visier-delivers-industry-first-enabling-companies-to-instantly-connect-their-workforce-to-business-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the press release</a>.\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Press-Release-Images_units-produced.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15384" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Press-Release-Images_units-produced.png" alt="Data visualization from Visier Workforce Intelligence solutions showing drivers for units produced, business outcome" width="966" height="352" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Visier customers can correlate workforce and business metrics, and discover what levers to pull to drive better business outcomes.</span></em></p>\n\n<h3><strong>Connecting the workforce to business results</strong></h3>\nWith Visier’s new business results capability, customers can answer critical business-shaping questions that are specific to their business. For example:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Retail businesses: Do stores where employees have longer tenure have higher sales?</li>\n \t<li>Energy providers: Are more training hours linked to a lower frequency of reported injuries?</li>\n \t<li>Healthcare providers: What workforce drivers correlate to lower patient readmission, or higher HCAHPS (patient satisfaction) scores?</li>\n \t<li>Manufacturers: How does our training spend relate to our defect rate?</li>\n \t<li>Financial Services organizations: Is the amount of variable compensation paid linked to the number of new insurance policies written?</li>\n \t<li>Technology developers: How does time in position relate to the first-call resolution rate of support calls?</li>\n</ul>\nWith an innovative <a href="https://www.visier.com/tech-insights/ultimate-big-data-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applied Big Data</a> business model, Visier includes turnkey data onboarding and management with its annual Software-as-a-Service subscription, never charging customers for adding or changing a data source. This now includes onboarding a custom set of business result metrics for each customer, such as revenue, profit, cost of goods sold, customer satisfaction index, patient readmission rates, patient satisfaction scores, net promoter score, monthly call volumes, and many more.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Delivering Insights On the Go</strong></h3>\nVisier Workforce Analytics WINTER 2016 also includes a new iPhone application, providing leaders and HR business partners with access to workforce and employee insights on the go.

      '<h2><em>New capability lets companies identify exactly what workforce levers to pull to improve revenue, profit, customer satisfaction, and other business outcomes</em></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</strong> - Visier, the leader in People Analytics, today announced a game-changing new capability that allows customers to instantly connect workforce metrics, such as turnover, engagement, and compensation, to business results, such as revenue, profit, customer satisfaction, and more. Included in <a href="https://www.visier.com/press-release/product-update-visier-delivers-key-new-functionality-to-enable-hr-to-better-drive-business-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visier’s WINTER 2016 product release</a>, the new capability revolutionizes the impact HR can have on business performance, enabling HR and business leaders to make workforce decisions with full knowledge of how those decisions will drive better business outcomes.\n\n“Connecting the workforce to business results has long been seen as the holy grail by business and HR leaders alike,” says John Schwarz, CEO and Founder, Visier. “Many companies have invested millions of dollars and years of effort in business intelligence projects in an attempt to make this connection, only to fail. Visier is the first to make it easy to connect workforce drivers to business results, giving companies unparalleled new insights into how to achieve greater business outcomes.”\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Press-Release-Images_revenue.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15379" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Data-visualization-showing-the-revenue-generated-per-full-time-employee.png" alt="Data visualization from Visier Workforce Intelligence solutions showing driving factors of business outcome, revenue." width="966" height="353" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>With Visier customers can correlate workforce and business metrics, and discover what levers to pull to drive better business outcomes.</em></p>\n\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><strong>Companies Achieve Business Results through their Workforce</strong></h3>\nResearch has shown that companies with a more diverse workforce outperform others; that retail outlets with highly engaged employees are more profitable; and that banks with greater employee retention achieve higher customer satisfaction. However, until Visier it was incredibly difficult for companies to directly correlate their workforce with their business results -- with the vast majority of attempts failing because the available tools and technology were too complex, costly, or constrained in capabilities.\n\n"Connecting business results to workforce metrics allows us to be more strategic with our workforce programs," said Morgan Turnipseed, Director of People Analytics at BBVA Compass, a leading U.S. banking franchise with operations throughout the Sunbelt region. "For example, by linking revenue with turnover rates at each of our 600+ bank branches, we\'re able to tailor an approach to retention that focuses on business impact, not just retention alone. The ease with which Visier makes this possible is instrumental in making our workforce initiatives successful and our HR function even more data-driven and critical to the business."\n\nRead the blog post: <a href="https://www.visier.com/hr-leadership/why-connecting-workforce-outcomes-to-business-outcomes-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Connecting the Workforce Outcomes to Business Outcomes Matters</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Visier Removes Cost, Complexity, and Capability Barriers</strong></h3>\nUp and running for new customers in less than 8 weeks, Visier People Analytics transforms how companies make decisions: from how to hire more top performers, to how to engage and retain them, to how to achieve better business results with them.\n\nWith an innovative <a href="https://www.visier.com/tech-insights/ultimate-big-data-cheat-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applied Big Data</a> business model, Visier includes turnkey data onboarding and management with its annual Software-as-a-Service subscription, never charging customers for adding or changing a data source. Uniquely, this data management is done by Visier for the customer, with little to no effort on the customer’s part, meaning customers can focus on high-value activities, such as business strategy and decision making, instead of getting mired in the mud of data processing and report creation.\n\nVisier’s turnkey data onboarding includes bringing together HR system data (such as from HR management, talent management, talent acquisition, payroll, performance management, and other workforce systems), as well as business data (such as from customer relationship, enterprise resource planning, supply chain, and financial systems). This unified data then automatically populates Visier’s hundreds of pre-built metrics and analytics, including advanced predictive analytics.\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Press-Release-Images_sales-per-square-foot.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15380" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Press-Release-Images_sales-per-square-foot.png" alt="Data visualization from Visier Workforce Intelligence showing drivers for Sales per square foot, a business outcome." width="967" height="391" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em>By bringing together workforce and business data, Visier enables companies to discover how to drive better business performance through their people.</em></p>\n“Great companies consistently make the best decisions about what to do, how to do it, and why,” says Schwarz. “Exceptional companies know the best people decisions drive the best business outcomes. We’re proud to be partnering with these exceptional companies, representing many of the world’s best brands.”\n<h4>About Visier</h4>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

While companies can produce reports on safety incidents, they aren’t able to easily correlate that data with workforce data to improve safety outcomes,” says Weisbeck. “Visier connects incident and workforce data, giving companies instant access to critical safety insights, replacing the weeks or months of analysis companies would otherwise have needed to perform.”\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the SPRING 2016 release, Visier now includes safety metrics and a Safety category in its Topic Guidebook, allowing customers to relate workforce attributes and metrics to the frequency and severity of safety incidents—including both near misses and incidents resulting in lost time. With this information, HR has the insights needed to make prevention plans more effective, create better-targeted training programs, and improve hiring.</span>\n\n<a href="/blog/3-ways-to-increase-workplace-safety-using-workforce-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read the article: Three Ways to Increase Workforce Safety with Workforce Intelligence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/spring-2016-safety.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16609" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/spring-2016-safety.png" alt="spring-2016-safety" width="3871" height="2596" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Visier, organizations can understand how the workforce relates to safety incidents, better than ever before </span></em></p>\n\n<h3><b>Correlating business results with multiple workforce metrics</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The SPRING 2016 release of Visier also builds on Visier’s </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/press-release/visier-delivers-industry-first-enabling-companies-to-instantly-connect-their-workforce-to-business-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">game-changing capability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to instantly connect workforce metrics, such as turnover, engagement, and compensation, to business results, such as revenue, profit, and customer satisfaction. The business results capability allows organizations to answer critical questions specific to their business, such as:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do stores where employees have longer tenure have higher sales?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does training spend relate to our defect rate?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the amount of variable compensation paid linked to the number of new insurance policies written?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does time in position relate to the first-call resolution rate of support calls?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now organizations can both compare a workforce metric side by side with a business result, and quickly identify which workforce metrics correlate with a business result. Visier customers can answer questions like:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What distinguishes my best support teams in achieving a best-in-class net promoter score?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can my underperforming sales teams learn from my best performing teams to produce higher revenue?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What employee behaviors of my production teams are correlated with higher units produced?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do leaders who have achieved the highest levels of employee engagement do differently than other leaders?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/spring-2016-business-outcomes.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16607" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/spring-2016-business-outcomes.png" alt="spring-2016-business-outcomes" width="4063" height="1763" /></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>With Visier customers can correlate workforce and business metrics, and discover what levers to pull to drive better business outcomes.</em></span></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier delivers new product releases each quarter.

The report, based on interviews by HBR-AS with HR practitioners at US Healthcare Providers, details four keys to success for any organization that wants to adopt workforce intelligence to make workforce decisions that drive better business outcomes.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘Never let a good crisis go to waste’ is an expression HR leaders at healthcare provider organizations understand well,” says John Schwarz, CEO and Founder, Visier. “Healthcare providers are facing the need for dramatic HR transformations, brought on by healthcare reform, an aging workforce, and the shortage of skilled human resources. Successful and effective transformations require deep insight into the demographics, flexibility, and engagement of employees at all levels of the organization. Without such insight, critical people decisions are based on guesses.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Read John Schwarz’s blog post, <a href="/blog/why-workforce-intelligence-is-essential-to-hr-transformation-a-healthcare-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Workforce Intelligence Is Essential to HR Transformation: A Healthcare Perspective</a>.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For this report, HBR-AS interviewed HR practitioners at US healthcare providers, as well as industry experts, to find out what drives healthcare providers to pursue workforce intelligence and how they are advancing. Their experiences offer four lessons for any organization that wants to adopt workforce intelligence platforms to make workforce decisions better aligned with business outcomes:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seize on a compelling business need</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cultivate executive support</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demonstrate the value</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start small but aim big</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of our study’s key findings was that each HR organization that had successfully adopted workforce intelligence has a CHRO who is trusted by C-suite colleagues as a true business partner and who was able to make the case for a data-driven decision approach to other top executives,” says Alex Clemente, managing director of Harvard Business Review Analytic Services. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This report is the fourth in a series of studies performed by HBR-AS:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HR Joins the Analytics Revolution</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://hello.visier.com/hbr-ceo-chro-connect-people-business-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Changing Role of the CHRO</span></a></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://hello.visier.com/collaborative-workforce-planning-align-hr-finance-talent-acquisition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tackling Talent Strategically: Winning with Workforce Planning</span></a></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spearheading HR Transformation with Workforce Intelligence: Lessons from the Healthcare Industry</span></li>\n</ul>\nFind data-driven HR insights and tips at <a href="/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.visier.com/clarity</a>\nFollow Visier on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/visier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Visier</a>\nLike Visier on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Visier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>\n<h4><b>About Visier</b></h4>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      "U.S. Study on Gender Pay Equity Discovers New Key to Closing the Gender Wage Gap: The Manager Divide",
    Content:
      '<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysis uncovers definitive link between the underrepresentation of women in manager positions and the gender wage gap in US enterprises</span></i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">SAN JOSE, CA and VANCOUVER, BC – June </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 2016—A new study from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the leader in Workforce Intelligence, has found that mothers in the US continue to pay the price in career advancement and wages for starting a family. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Insights™: Gender Equity </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">report,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">published today, uncovers a direct correlation between the Manager Divide</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a growing underrepresentation of women compared to men in manager positions from age 32 onwards, and a widening of the gender wage gap for large US employers. The report finds that eliminating the Manager Divide, which coincides with the years in which women typically have children, would cut the gender wage gap by nearly one third. </span>\n\n<a href="https://hello.visier.com/gender-equity-report-visier-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Download the Gender Equity report.</span></a>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every CEO should be looking at gender equity,” says John Schwarz, Founder and CEO, Visier. “Countless studies have shown the equal economic contribution women make in the workforce, yet companies have struggled to achieve the goal of equity in compensation. With this Visier Insights report—made possible by the contribution of our customers to our unique workforce database—we give leaders the factual basis on which to implement programs that can accelerate gender equity. It turns out that the gender inequity is not just a compensation issue, it is a problem of unequal participation of women in the higher paying managerial jobs.”</span>\n<h3><b>The Gender Wage Gap</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous studies highlight that the gender wage gap cannot simply be explained as “unequal pay for equal work.” Rather, they have proven gender pay inequity to be a systemic challenge where women as a whole earn less than men on average, and do so across education levels and occupations. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As discovered by Visier Insights, the gender wage gap is driven by the Manager Divide: gender inequity in manager positions that is closely tied to the childcare years, when women experience increased demands from their home life. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having a child shouldn’t undermine the earning potential of women, but our study shows that it still does,” says Schwarz. “I believe employers today have good intentions to achieve gender equity, but have been lost in chaotic and conflicting data sources. Business leaders need to be  making decisions based on confident knowledge, not on guesswork. We at Visier are on a mission to enable that.”</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>Key Report Findings</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on analysis of a workforce database representing dozens of large U.S. enterprises, the Visier Insights study found:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is an increase in voluntary turnover and a pronounced dip in the percentage of women in the workforce between the ages of 25 and 40 (from 43% to 39%), the same age range in which women commonly have children</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gender wage gap widens at age 32, starting with women earning 90% the wages of men, and decreasing to women earning 82% the wages of men by age 40</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;">Women are underrepresented in manager positions from age 32 onwards—the same age at which the wage gap between men and women broadens</li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manager wages are, on average, 2 times that of non-manager wages</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having the same representation of women in manager positions as men would reduce the gender wage gap to 10% across all age groups -- an improvement most notable for the age 32 and older population</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Read the blog: </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/hr-leadership/overcoming-the-manager-divide-how-hr-can-accelerate-the-path-to-gender-pay-equity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overcoming the Manager Divide: How to accelerate the path to Gender Pay Equity. </span></a>\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Visier-Insights-GenderReport-Charts.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-16886" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Visier-Insights-GenderReport-Charts.png" alt="Key findings from the Visier Insights Gender Report about Gender Equity in the Workplace" width="3333" height="3150" /></a>\n<h3><b>Slashing the Gender Wage Gap by closing the Manager Divide </b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of important steps employers can take to make meaningful progress towards closing the gender gap.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement the Rooney Rule: for every manager position you have open to fill, consider “at least one woman and one underrepresented minority” in your slate of candidates</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implement blind screening, removing names (or other gender identifiers) from resumes when selecting candidates for interviews</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increase measurement and awareness of gender equity in the rollout or implementation of HR policies, including compensation policies</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, leaders, workers, and community members alike can work to eradicate the gender wage gap:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support meaningful paid parental leave that is equal for both men and women</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure it is socially acceptable for both men and women to take time off to care for their children</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support programs that increase the availability of good quality affordable childcare for all parents</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure it is socially acceptable for both mothers and fathers to make use of flexible working time arrangements to care for children</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop and support long-term programs—starting in grade school, throughout high school and college—aimed at removing the gender bias and social taboos associated with career choices</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have more ideas?

Yet, applicant tracking and HR systems provide limited insight into how to improve recruiting efficiency and results,” says Dave Weisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer, Visier. “With Visier Talent Acquisition we are enabling organizations to outsmart their competition by having a clear and complete understanding of how to consistently hire the best people.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Read the articles:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.visier.com/tech-insights/predicting-time-to-fill-for-a-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Visier Works: Predicting Time-to-Fill For a Job</a></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.visier.com/workforce-intelligence-101/5-benefits-of-data-driven-recruitment/?utm_campaign=b8416a&amp;utm_medium=w&amp;utm_source=rr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five Benefits of a Data-Driven Recruitment Strategy</span></a></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.visier.com/workforce-intelligence-101/analytics-helps-prevent-another-bad-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Talent Acquisition Analytics Helps Prevent Another Bad Hire</span></a></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.visier.com/workforce-intelligence-101/how-do-you-improve-your-candidate-experience-look-at-your-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Do You Improve Your Candidate Experience?

In this tight talent market, a Talent Acquisition leader’s reliance on guesswork to forecast how long it will take to fill a role introduces significant business risk. Visier Talent Acquisition replaces guesswork with accurate predictions. Leveraging its machine learning technology, Visier accurately predicts how long a role will take to fill based on the organization’s historic hiring data. This includes, for the role or group of roles selected, assessing the quality of the data sample size, analyzing past time-to-fill data for the role(s), and calculating time-to-fill based on three likelihoods -- all in real time.</span>\n\n<a href="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/visier-talent-acquistion-pipeline-trend.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-18114" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/visier-talent-acquistion-pipeline-trend.png" alt="Leveraging its advanced predictive analytics technology, Visier forecasts in real time how long it will take to fill a role, based on the organization’s historic data." width="800" height="518" /></a>\n<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Leveraging its advanced predictive analytics technology, Visier forecasts in real time how long it will take to fill a role, based on the organization’s historic data. </em></span></p>\n\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><b>Quality of Hire: Track Effectiveness of Hires Across the Employee Lifecycle</b></h3>\nQuality of hire is the most valued recruiting metric, yet most organizations are unable to measure it effectively: their Applicant Tracking System or HR Management System only considers a subset of data to calculate hire quality, and does not take into account data from other systems, such as employee performance, promotion, tenure, or compensation data.

      '<h2><em>New Survey Results Highlight Need for Companies to Better Measure Long-Term Impact of Talent Acquisition</em></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</strong> — A new study from Visier, the leader in People Analytics, has found that although organizations today are spending more money than ever on recruiting, 52% of hiring managers are unable to predict the long-term success of their new hires. Furthermore, the study found that 71% of hiring managers said that to increase the quality of people they hire, HR needs to improve its recruiting process.\n\nAn October 2016 study—conducted by <a href="https://www.researchnow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Research Now</a> on behalf of Visier—surveyed 200 hiring managers at companies with annual revenues of $1 billion or more across the United States. The hiring managers were asked about their views on the talent acquisition process at their organizations, and the results reveal significant frustration due to the lack of ability to measure long-term impact.\n\nThe challenges faced by hiring managers extend to the day-to-day decisions they need to make, as well as to their ability to make long-term hiring plans. The survey also found:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Long-term impact of recruiting is hard to measure:</strong> 61% said that it is difficult to measure the long-term impact of the overall recruiting process.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Time to hire estimates are not accurate</strong>: 66% of hiring managers agree that when hiring for a role, it is difficult to get an accurate estimate of how long it will take to secure the hire.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Hiring plans are not effective</strong>: 55% of hiring managers agree that hiring plans were not as effective as they could be due to the difficulty in getting accurate hiring and turnover projections.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Recruiting programs need to be more data driven:</strong> 70% said that to improve long-term business impact, recruiting programs at their organization need to be more data-driven or fact-based.</li>\n</ul>\nIn the survey, hiring managers also expressed their need to access more information about the talent acquisition process and the candidates they were considering. In particular:\n<ul>\n \t<li>95% said they need to know why good candidates are lost during the hiring process.</li>\n \t<li>82% said it is important to track diversity and ensure equity during the hiring process.</li>\n</ul>\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19598" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Demand-for-Data-Driven-Talent-Acquisition.png" alt="demand-for-data-driven-talent-acquisition" width="5692" height="3200" />\n\n“With hiring managers unable to determine the long-term success of half the candidates they hire, hiring is reduced to a coin toss. This highlights the critical need for organizations to improve the way that they measure the effectiveness of their talent acquisition,” says Dave Weisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer, Visier. “Visier Talent Acquisition is the only solution to predict long-term business impact by delivering the most comprehensive insights across the entire recruiting lifecycle.”\n\nWith <a href="/solutions/talent-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visier Talent Acquisition</a>, organizations can answer critical questions about the talent acquisition process and improve the impact of recruiting on the business by:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Tracking the effectiveness of hires across the employee lifecycle</li>\n \t<li>Improving and predicting the speed of hiring</li>\n \t<li>Uncovering how to prevent talent leaks</li>\n \t<li>Ensuring diversity and equity across the hiring process</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Survey Methodology</strong>\n\n200 hiring managers from across the United States—representing a wide range of industries—took the survey, fielded online by Research Now Inc. on behalf of Visier in October 2016.

    Content:
      '<h2><strong>Visier customers achieve an average return on equity more than double the U.S. average, and reduce manager resignations by 30% within two years of using Visier</strong></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Analysis finds the value enterprises gain from Visier People® includes strategic business benefits, such as improved margins and increased revenue per employee; savings and gains from improved HR effectiveness; and savings from technology and labor cost efficiencies.</em>\n\nVANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA – February 21, 2017 — A new study from Visier, developer of the leading people strategy platform, has found that when organizations use workforce data to inform their people decisions and strategies, they significantly outperform businesses that do not. The study, which analyzed key financial performance metrics from publicly-traded Visier customers and compared them to public data, found that Visier customers earned a 22.1% average return on equity, more than double the U.S. market average of 10.8%.\n\nAs well, the study found Visier customers achieved significant HR and business benefits, including: reducing manager resignation rates by 30% and critical talent resignation rates by 44%; increasing margins; and increasing revenue per employee.\n\n“Today, more than ever, corporate strategy hinges on people strategy, giving HR a massive opportunity to create value for the business,” says John Schwarz, Founder and CEO, Visier. “This report highlights how companies that adopt Visier People as their people strategy platform create better business outcomes, achieving a clear competitive advantage.”\n\nResearch for the Economic Impact report -- which was led by <a href="/press-release/visier-appoints-lexy-martin-principal-of-research-and-customer-value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lexy Martin</a>, Visier’s Principal for Research and Customer Value, and former lead author of the Sierra-Cedar Human Resources Systems Survey, the longest running and most acclaimed HR tech survey -- found that Visier customers are experiencing significant business benefits.\n\n“The value of people analytics grows as organizations mature in their use of it,” says Lexy Martin, Principal for Research and Customer Value, Visier. “Initial value is often calculated in terms of cost efficiencies gained through the adoption of a new technology solution. This is typically followed by measuring, analyzing and ultimately improving key HR metrics – for instance, reducing unwanted turnover. Finally, organizations that are the most advanced in the use of people analytics can connect their people strategy and decisions to the improvement of key business outcomes, such as revenue, profits, customer satisfaction, margins, or industry-specific metrics.”\n\n<strong>Key Visier Economic Impact Report Findings:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Reduced Resignation Rates:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>After using Visier for two years, the quit rates of Visier customers for their overall employee population dropped from 40% to 48% below average rates as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics — a 13% improvement compared to the overall market. A 10,000-person organization that reduces turnover by a total of 13% can reduce its workforce costs by more than $15 million per year.</li>\n \t<li>After using Visier for two years, Visier customers experienced an average 30% decrease in manager-level employees resignations -- a significant improvement given hiring and retaining top-level managers is more difficult than ever before.</li>\n \t<li>A Visier banking industry customer used Visier to identify how to improve retention of an important revenue-producing role at bank branches experiencing high turnover, and reduced the annual turnover rate for that role by 44%.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li><strong>Business Impact and Strategic Value:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A financial services firm used Visier to assess the effectiveness of different initiatives to reduce turnover, including addressing pay inequities, improving manager communications with employees, and training and development programs. The firm saw an uplift of $200,000 in annual revenue for every retained employee who received additional training.</li>\n \t<li>A Visier manufacturing customer identified how they could improve performance—and decrease costs—by better connecting compensation policies to employee results.</li>\n \t<li>A Visier professional services customer optimized the makeup of its consulting teams for multi-year, multi-million-dollar contracts— improving margins by $1 to $3 million per contract.</li>\n \t<li>A Visier financial services customer improved the accuracy of its workforce plan from 78% to 95%, identifying a surplus of roughly $97 million the business could invest elsewhere.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li><strong>53% Greater Revenue Per Employee:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Aggregate performance can also be measured in terms of revenue per employee. Visier customers generate an average of $641,100 in revenue per employee, outperforming other U.S. organizations by 53%.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li><strong>More Than Double Return On Equity:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>When publicly-traded Visier customers are compared to all U.S. organizations, Visier customers outperform. In January 2016 the average return on equity across all industry sectors in the U.S. was 10.8%. For publicly-traded Visier customers, the average return on equity in September 2016 was 22.1%, more than double the average of all publicly-traded U.S. organizations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li><strong>Technology Cost Savings:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Because the Visier product is delivered as a service and -- uniquely -- all costs are included in the annual subscription, Visier’s total cost is typically 5-20% of the cost of building a custom solution -- and organizations can be up and running in less than eight weeks.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li><strong>Labor Cost Savings:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Visier also generates substantial labor cost efficiencies. By implementing Visier, Forrester Consulting identified that Yahoo saved $2,238,167 over three years by reducing the number of employees it would have needed to hire for its workforce analytics and reporting team.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>About Visier</strong>\n\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      "<h2><strong>Donations part of corporate-wide Visier Gives initiative, which encourages employees to give back to their communities with four paid days off for volunteer activities each year</strong></h2>\nVANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA — Visier, the leader in Workforce Intelligence, has made a series of donations to Simon Fraser University’s Faculty of Applied Sciences (SFU) and the University of British Columbia’s Faculty of Science/Department of Computer Science (UBC) to encourage students to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and the advancement of women in STEM-related fields.\n\nThese donations are part of a corporate-wide giving program, Visier Gives, that encourages employees to give back to their communities supported by four paid days off for volunteer activities each year.\n\nThe labor shortage facing technology companies in British Columbia and around the world is well documented. In Canada alone the Information and Communications Technology Council (ICTC) projects that 182,000 skilled IT workers will be needed by 2019, with another 36,000 by 2020. By teaming with two world-renowned local Universities, Visier aims to foster an interest in STEM, leadership, and entrepreneurship amongst youth and to help remove barriers to full participation STEM careers by women.\n\n“While the race to out-innovate with new ideas and products fuels the technology industry at large, the competition between companies is fought most pervasively on the talent front lines,” said Ryan Wong, President &amp; CTO, Visier. “Innovation and ideas come from people. Knowing the potential of STEM, we’ve decided that a key cornerstone of our Visier Gives program will be to encourage more youth, and especially young women, to explore their interest in STEM.”\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Visier Partners with SFU Faculty of Applied Sciences to create opportunities for youth, especially for girls, to explore STEM careers</strong></h3>\nIn partnership with SFU, Visier will support the following programs:\n<ul>\n \t<li>SFU Technovation: A 12-week competition (running from January to May each year) that invites local girls aged 10-18 to work in teams with tech industry mentors to learn how to code and develop an app that addresses a local community issue. Selected finalists then move on to compete in the Technovation World Pitch Summit held in the Silicon Valley.</li>\n \t<li>Science AL!VE: A student-run, non-profit science education program based at SFU, that encourages, inspires and exposes youth of all backgrounds to STEM through hands-on and interactive activities. Science AL!VE reached over 9,500 youth in 2015 through classroom and on-campus workshops, summer camps, year-round girls clubs, and many community outreach programs.</li>\n \t<li>Try/CATCH (Computing and Technology Conference for Her): A one-day event organized specifically for high school girls from grades eight to twelve, with the objective of fostering curiosity about computing science and engineering, and providing basic knowledge to serve as a foundation for more advanced skills.</li>\n \t<li>Annual WiCS-WiE hackathon: An intense 12 hour ideation and coding competition between students from across the Faculty of Applied Sciences. Industry members participate as team mentors and judges.</li>\n</ul>\n“In order to convince more women to pursue careers in STEM, it is crucial that we provide opportunities for young girls to engage in fun activities that help to counter stereotypes surrounding STEM fields. Visier’s commitment to fund programs that engage and inspire the next generation of women to pursue STEM has the potential to benefit society as a whole by increasing the diversity and innovation of those in the STEM fields,” says Dr. Lesley Shannon,\nNSERC Chair for Women in Science and Engineering (BC/Yukon), Associate Professor, School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><strong>Visier Teams Up with UBC Faculty of Science to Support Computer Science Undergrads</strong></h3>\nIn partnership with UBC, Visier will support the following programs:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Visier Project Kickstart Fund: Visier has made a donation to start a new Project Club to encourage Computer Science undergraduate students to create new projects, whether on their own or as a team.</li>\n \t<li>Visier Service Award in Computer Science: A service award has been created for undergraduate students pursuing a degree in Computer Science which will be chosen by the Department of Computer Science for students in good academic standing who have demonstrated excellence in fields such as community service, student leadership, and volunteerism.</li>\n \t<li>Visier Service Award for Women in Computer Science: An award for a female undergraduate student applying to pursue a degree in Computer Science.

      '<h2><strong>Visier gives Talent Acquisition leaders the insights needed to strategically allocate spending to drive the greatest hiring results</strong></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, developer of the </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/blog/visier-people-strategy-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading people strategy platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, today announced enhancements to </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/solutions/talent-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Talent Acquisition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that enable Talent Acquisition leaders to accurately analyze the effectiveness of their recruiting spending.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the talent market gets tighter, it’s critical for companies not only to stay on top of hiring costs, but also to ensure their spending actually leads to better hires,” says Dave Weisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer, Visier. “With Visier, Talent Acquisition leaders can gain a complete view of their hiring expenses, and identify how to strategically allocate their budget to drive the greatest results.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For most large enterprises, assessing the full breadth of direct hiring costs is a challenge: costs occur at different times and are recorded in a number of disparate systems. As a result, companies struggle to understand, for example, if their investment in candidate assessments leads to more high-performing employees, or which hiring sources are best when quick hires are needed.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Talent Acquisition brings together—in one place—all cost information directly associated with a specific hire, and allows Talent Acquisition teams to answer important best practice questions, such as:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which sources produce the most qualified applicants at the lowest cost?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does spending more per hire leads to a shorter time to fill?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do the costs of different hiring sources compare to the success rate and time to fill for requisitions?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure that key open positions receive the right investment, how can we compare costs for different types of hires?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does increased spending lead to better quality hires?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<img class="aligncenter wp-image-23887" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Data-visualization-from-Visier-Talent-Acquisition-showing-what-are-the-direct-costs-for-hiring.png" alt="Data visualization from Visier Talent Acquisition showing what are the direct costs for hiring" width="801" height="471" />\n<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Talent Acquisition enables talent acquisition leaders to analyze direct hiring costs in a consistent way.</span></i></p>\n<img class="aligncenter wp-image-23889" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Data-visualization-from-Visier-Talent-Acquisition-showing-whether-spending-more-on-hiring-results-in-better-new-hire-quality.png" alt="Data visualization from Visier Talent Acquisition showing whether spending more on hiring results in better new-hire quality" width="795" height="463" />\n<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Talent Acquisition allows organizations to review whether spending more on hiring results in better new-hire quality.</span></i></p>\n<img class="aligncenter wp-image-23888" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Data-visualization-from-Visier-Talent-Acquisition-showing-whether-spending-more-on-hiring-reduces-hiring-times.png" alt="Data visualization from Visier Talent Acquisition showing whether spending more on hiring reduces hiring times" width="766" height="750" />\n<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Visier Talent Acquisition, organizations can see whether spending more on hiring reduces hiring times.</span></i></p>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Talent Acquisition is part of the </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Workforce Intelligence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solution.

    Title: "U.S. Study Reveals Systemic Ageism Exists in Tech Hiring Practices",
    Content:
      '<h2><strong>Visier Insights analysis discovers that although Tech rates performance of Gen X and Baby Boomers higher than their Non-Tech counterparts, Tech hiring decisions favor Millennials</strong></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">SAN JOSE, Calif. and VANCOUVER, September 26, 2017 – Visier, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">developer of the </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/hr-leadership/visier-people-strategy-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading people strategy platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has revealed the results of its study citing that systemic age discrimination exists within tech hiring practices. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Insights™:  The Truth About Ageism in the Tech Industry</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report uncovers a paradox: despite receiving more Top Performer ratings as they age than their Non-Tech counterparts, Gen Xers in Tech are being hired 33% less (and Baby Boomers 60% less) than their workforce representation, while Millennials in Tech are being hired almost a whopping 50% more than their workforce representation. In notable contrast, in Non-Tech, Gen Xers are being hired only 22% less than their workforce representation. Simply put, a Gen Xer has a significantly lower chance of being hired in Tech. For Baby Boomers, the chances of being hired in Tech and Non-Tech are the same.</span>\n\n<a href="https://hello.visier.com/truth-about-ageism-tech-visier-insights-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Download the Ageism in Tech report</b></a>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Balancing a team’s skills and experience is critical for Tech leaders, and can make or break a company,” says Dave Weisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer, Visier. “As our Visier Insights research shows, Tech companies that design a recruitment strategy around Millennials alone are shortsighted, overlooking the performance and experience that Gen Xers and Baby Boomers bring to the table.”</span>\n<h3><b>The Tech Sage Age</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Insights: The Truth about Ageism in Tech</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report predictably finds the average age of Tech workers to be younger than their Non-Tech counterparts (38 years old, compared to 43 years old for non-tech workers), the report clarifies some key misconceptions related to the salary lifecycle, resignation rates, and perceived value of older workers. In reality, experience and maturity are more valued in Tech than in Non-Tech industries: from age 40 onwards, non-manager workers in Tech enter the “Tech Sage Age” and are increasingly likely to receive a Top Performer rating as they age, mature, and gain experience, compared to Non-Tech.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">"It’s more important than ever for business leaders to be acquiring the best and brightest talent available, regardless of age," says Weisbeck. "With Visier People™, our mission is to provide leaders with the workforce insights they need to make more informed people decisions -- driving better business outcomes.”</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>Key Report Findings</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on an analysis of 330,000 employees from 43 large U.S. enterprises, a subset of Visier’s workforce database, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Insights</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study found:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Finding #1: Systemic Ageism Exists in Tech Hiring Practices</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The study found that while older Tech non-managers are consistently rated higher performers than their Non-Tech counterparts, they are less likely to be hired. From age 40 onwards, non-managers in Tech enter what Visier has coined as the “Tech Sage Age” and are increasingly likely to receive a Top Performer rating as they age, mature, and gain experience, compared to Non-Tech. Despite this, while in Tech 41% of available talent is Gen X, Gen X makes up only 27% of new hires (a ratio of 0.67). In contrast, having a similar proportion of available Gen X talent (45%), in Non-Tech, Gen X makes up 35% of new hires (a ratio of 0.78). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\n</span></li>\n</ul>\n<img class="aligncenter wp-image-25585" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Visier-Insights-Ageism-in-Tech-graph-showing-the-ratio-of-new-hires-to-available-non-manager-workforce-composition-by-age-in-the-tech-and-non-tech-organizations.png" alt="Visier Insights Ageism in Tech graph showing the ratio of new hires to available non-manager workforce composition by age in the tech and non-tech organizations" width="534" height="457" />\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not all bad news for older Tech workers. Despite finding evidence of ageism in hiring, older Tech workers do not take a hit in salary.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key finding #2:</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older Tech workers do not experience a drop in salary: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older Tech workers as a group do not experience a reduction in average salary that is any different from their counterparts in Non-Tech industries. Rather, workers in Tech experience the same salary lifecycle as their counterparts in Non-Tech. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\n</span></li>\n</ul>\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25586" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Visier-Insights-Ageism-in-Tech-graph-showing-median-salary-by-age-for-non-managers.png" alt="Visier Insights Ageism in Tech graph showing median salary by age for non-managers" width="537" height="497" />\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key finding #3: Newly hired older Tech workers are on average paid equitably: </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older Tech workers that are newly hired do not—on average—experience a lower wage. Rather, newly hired workers are paid the same average salary as more tenured workers, across all age groups.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25555" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Visier-Insights-Ageism-in-Tech-graph-showing-median-base-pay-for-new-hires-compared-to-all-workers-by-age.png" alt="Visier Insights Ageism in Tech graph showing median base pay for new hires compared to all workers by age" width="535" height="499" />\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key finding #4:</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older Tech Workers Resign at Lower Rates:</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For both Tech and Non-Tech industries, resignation rates are highest for Millennials, dropping as workers age, and stabilizing at an average rate of 10% for Gen Xers and Baby Boomers. The message to employers: hiring more Gen X and Baby Boomer talent will provide more stability in their workforce and reduce turnover costs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\n</span></li>\n</ul>\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-25560" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Visier-Insights-Ageism-in-Tech-graph-showing-resignation-rate-by-age-for-tech-and-non-tech-workers.png" alt="Visier Insights Ageism in Tech graph showing resignation rate by age for tech and non-tech workers" width="522" height="477" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>How Business Leaders Can Root Out the Risk of Ageism in their Workforce </b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of important steps employers can take to acquire the best and brightest talent available, regardless of age:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Review your workforce data to understand the current state of age equity within your organizations to find any signs of potential bias in hiring, promotions, salary levels, turnover, and performance ratings.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that, as with ethnic and gender equity, age equity is a cultural issue – if pockets of ageism exist within your organization, you will need to devise plans to address them not only via better HR practice and policy rollouts, but through culture change. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider implementing a version of the Rooney Rule for age, specifically for teams or roles where the workforce is less diverse in age: for every position you have open to fill, consider one or more older candidates (or candidates that will help create a more diverse team, in general).</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Develop hiring practices that reduce the potential for intentional or unintentional bias in the screening out of older applicants.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have more ideas?

Yet many spend tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars on Learning and Development, without the ability to accurately measure its impact on the business.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier, developer of </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Workforce Intelligence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/hr-leadership/visier-people-strategy-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading people strategy platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, today announced the launch of a new learning and development analytics solution, Visier Learning. Part of the Visier Workforce Intelligence solution, Visier Learning provides HR and business leaders with answers in seconds to pre-built, best practice learning and development questions, letting them quickly translate these insights into better HR and business outcomes. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every hour that an employee spends on training is a non-productive hour—so leaders want to make sure the time spent learning has a significant impact later,” says Dave Weisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer, Visier. “But measuring the impact of learning investments is typically a manual, time-consuming process—and one that only uncovers a fraction of the valuable insights available.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">\nRead the articles:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.visier.com/workforce-intelligence-101/measure-learning-developments-business-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Measure Learning and Development’s Business Impact</span></a></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.visier.com/workforce-intelligence-101/5-learning-development-questions-cant-answer-without-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 Learning and Development Questions You Can’t Answer Without Analytics</span></a></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.visier.com/workforce-intelligence-101/3-data-driven-better-compliance-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Data-Driven Ways to Better Manage Compliance Training</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">\nWith Visier Learning—which connects a company’s learning and development data with their data from talent management, core HR, and business systems—leaders can continuously measure the impact of their learning programs. That means they’ll be able to see which programs are working—and which aren’t. </span>\n<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26076" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Visier-Learning-data-visualization-showing-how-learning-and-development-impacts-resignation-rates.png" alt="Visier Learning data visualization showing how learning and development impacts resignation rates" width="2140" height="1808" /><b>Structure training spend to maximize its value</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As the money that companies and their competitors invest in learning programs continues to rise, it’s important to know where organizations can get the best bang for their buck. Visier Learning helps leaders see which employee attributes lead to the most success with learning programs, allowing them to discover where to make the best investment.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>Track and compare time to productivity for new employees</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Good learning delivery is focused on increasing the productivity of employees. This is especially true for employees who are newly hired. Visier Learning allows organizations to track and compare the time to productivity of employees, identifying those characteristics which lead to the most successful employees.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>Increase leadership development and succession readiness</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For most organizations, leadership development makes up a large part of the training spend—but because it happens on such a long timeline, it’s difficult to know whether it’s better to build the succession pipeline from within or hire leaders from outside the organization. With Visier Learning, companies will be able to connect employee performance to development programs—helping them build a rich succession pipeline and ensure the long-term health of the organization.</span>\n<h3><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26075" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Visier-Learning-data-visualization-showing-how-leadership-development-increases-promotion-rates.png" alt="Visier Learning data visualization showing how leadership development increases promotion rates" width="2137" height="1247" /><b>Forecast certification coverage</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having employees with the rights certifications and credentials is critical to business operations. But it’s difficult to know with certainty how many certified people a company will have on any given date in the future—and it’s hard to know how to schedule the right amount of training to meet demand. Visier Learning uses historical data to predict how many certified employees you will have, helping you decide whether to ramp up certification programs to avoid shutting down parts of your business or slowing down production.</span>\n\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26074" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Visier-Learning-data-visualization-showing-how-certification-coverage-has-changed-year-of-year.png" alt="Visier Learning data visualization showing how certification coverage has changed year of year" width="1981" height="1689" />\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information, visit: </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/solutions/learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.visier.com/solutions/learning/</span></a>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Find data-driven HR insights and tips at <a href="https://www.visier.com/clarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.visier.com/clarity</a></span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow Visier on Twitter </span><a href="https://twitter.com/visier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@Visier</span></a>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier and Visier logo are trademarks of Visier, Inc.

      '<span style="font-weight: 400;">SAN JOSE, Calif. and VANCOUVER, October 9, 2017 – Visier, developer of </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Workforce Intelligence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/hr-leadership/visier-people-strategy-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading people strategy platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, today announced Visier Benchmarks, a new capability that will allow customers to easily compare data about their own workforce to confidentially sourced benchmark data from Visier customers.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every organization wants to compare their results to accurate, complete, and timely data on their peers and competitors,” says Dave Weisbeck, Chief Strategy Officer, Visier. “Yet–until now– the benchmarks available to employers have been based on self-reported surveys that are compiled once a year, meaning they are incomplete, inaccurate, and out of date. With Visier Benchmarks, companies are able to access timely and relevant comparison data.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Included as part of the Visier Workforce Intelligence solution, Visier Benchmarks will use data that is sourced directly from Visier customers. Visier Benchmarks complements government-published measures such as those from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics—also available directly within Visier—by adding even more relevant context and timeliness.</span>\n<h3><b>Designed for the Speed of Business Decisions</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Benchmarks will be available on demand and include workforce metrics the business cares most about, such as resignation and promotion rates, with a level of detail that allows actionable insights where it matters. For instance, users will be able to see benchmarks by performance groups, tenure ranges, manager status, age, diversity, region, and industry. Because Visier Benchmark data is generated automatically from integrating data across Visier customers, users will have real-time access to up-to-date benchmarks.</span>\n<h3><b>Data from Peers</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Benchmarks data comes from large organizations—ranging from thousands to hundreds of thousands of employees across a span of industries—making them more relevant comparison points for large employers than government data, which can come from organizations with as few as 50 employees.</span>\n<h3><b>Unbiased Information</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Benchmarks includes data for all employees—instead of a self-selected sample of respondents that can lead to biased results. Because workforce information is collected and standardized directly from systems of record, Visier Benchmarks are more reliable than surveys that rely on subjective self-reports.</span>\n\nFind data-driven HR insights and tips at <a href="https://www.visier.com/clarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.visier.com/clarity</a>\n\nFollow Visier on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/visier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Visier</a>\n\nVisier and Visier logo are trademarks of Visier, Inc.

Who should be considered for a promotion or a new role? Predictive workforce analytics provide incredible opportunities for employers to curb costs and improve performance, yet many are based on simple regressions or static models, instead of machine learning technology, or are unproven in the accuracy of their results.</span>\n\n<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26092" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Visier-Machine-Learning-data-visualization-showing-a-prediction-for-who-has-the-highest-propensity-for-promotion.png" alt="Visier Machine Learning data visualization showing a prediction for who has the highest propensity for promotion" width="1252" height="659" />\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier, developer of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Workforce Intelligence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/hr-leadership/visier-people-strategy-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading people strategy platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has changed this paradigm.

Data scientists have verified that predictions made using Visier are up to 17 times more accurate than other approaches. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier predictions are continually trained on employee data and events, including promotions, resignations, and internal hires, so that companies can stay up to date on which employees should be considered for a promotion—and predict which employees are most likely to leave or change jobs.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Importantly, the accuracy of Visier’s machine learning analytics can now be validated directly by Visier customers to confirm how close the actual number of exits, promotions, and internal moves were to their predicted values—and increase the trust of their stakeholders in turn. Further, to even better adapt predictions to the needs of an organization, customers can configure and personalize exactly which attributes to use in training the predictive models.</span>\n\nFor more information, visit:<a href="https://www.visier.com/technology/"> https://www.visier.com/technology/</a>\n\nFind data-driven HR insights and tips at <a href="https://www.visier.com/clarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.visier.com/clarity</a>\n\nFollow Visier on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/visier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Visier</a>\n\nVisier and Visier logo are trademarks of Visier, Inc.

The company is also harnessing digitalization to drive innovation in the planning and management of one of its most important assets -- its people. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier’s people analytics is being used by nearly 3,000 managers and hundreds of HR practitioners to enable the company to glean insights into all aspects of HR work including workforce planning, talent management, and the optimization of day-to-day operations. Using Visier, teams can access data on headcount, diversity, turnover, performance results, and compensation, to make decisions on a wide variety of issues to improve performance and optimize organizational structure. With Visier, HR business partners are transforming from information providers and report generators into data-enabled consultants who are now strategic advisors to business managers. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not just HR doing analytics for HR. Our people analytics aims to increase the quality of people capital and the organizational decisions we make,” says Anna Lena Fritzsche, Manager People Analytics Consultancy &amp; Organization Development, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany.</span>\n\n<strong><a href="/customer-stories/merck-kgaa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read Merck KGaA case study.</a></strong>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Workforce Intelligence consolidates the company’s more than 45 million single data points from sources, including SAP, SuccessFactors, and an employee engagement system. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Managers and HR practitioners can access insights in Visier’s intuitive “question and answer” interface, which spans a wide range of topic areas related to organization and people management.

He says, “We’re honored to be recognized as one of the fastest growing technology companies in North America and thank our customers for their confidence in our solution.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year Visier announced it closed $45 million in Series D financing, bringing Visier’s total funding to $94.5 million.

      "Visier Insights’ Equal Pay Day Brief Finds Younger Female Workers Lost Ground in 2017",
    Content:
      '<h2>Lack of Improvement in the Gender Pay Gap Despite Women Outperforming Men</h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>SAN JOSE, CA and VANCOUVER, BC – April 10, 2018 —</b> Visier, the recognized leader in people analytics and planning, published the latest results to its ongoing study into gender equity. Despite significant media attention, large US employers are not making collective progress towards closing the gender pay gap. Visier Insights’ latest brief, released in recognition of US Equal Pay Day -- a day dedicated to raising awareness of the gender pay gap that symbolizes how far into the year women must work to earn what men earned in the previous year -- found that women under age 40 earned in 2017 an average of 79 cents for each dollar earned by men, compared to an average of 81 cents per dollar in 2015. Women over age 40 earned 72 cents per dollar in 2015 and 73 cents per dollar in 2017. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is surprising to learn is that, despite the great awareness of the gender equity issue, there is evidence that we have lost ground on this important measure of equality,” says John Schwarz, Founder and CEO, Visier. “These findings should be a wake-up call to business leaders, who should ensure their HR organizations are providing them with an unvarnished, accurate, and detailed view into gender equity, and how it is changing across their enterprise or industry.” </span>\n\n<a href="https://hello.visier.com/gender-equity-update-2018-visier-insights/">The full brief can be found here</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>,</strong> which includes graphics and recommendations for business leaders to take action to close the gender equity gaps in their organizations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data analyzed for this brief focused on large US-based employers, and included 60 companies representing 1.5 million employees.</span>\n\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-29011" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PayRatio-257x190.png" alt="PayRatio" width="620" height="459" />\n\n<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caption: The gender wage gap increased in 2017 for workers under age 40. The shown pay ratio is the average salary of female employees divided by the average salary of male employees.</span></i>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>While the pay gap widens, women are outperforming their male colleagues</b></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of improvement in the gender pay gap comes at a time when women are significantly outperforming their male colleagues. When comparing the performance ratings of men and women in 2015, 2016 and 2017, women are increasingly achieving top performer status more frequently than men. In 2017, women were 21% more likely to achieve top performer status than men, compared to 12% more likely in 2015. For managers, the growth  in the gender performance gap was even greater, as female managers were 22% more likely than male managers to be rated as top performers in 2017, up from 7% in 2015.</span>\n\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-29010" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/GenderPerfRatio-257x190.png" alt="GenderPerfRatio" width="620" height="459" />\n\n<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caption: Women are increasingly ranked as top performers, compared to men. The shown gender performance ratio is the proportion of female employees in the high performance group divided by the proportion of male employees in the high performance group.</span></i>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>Age plays a role in promotions</b></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the higher likelihood of women being top performers, there is a considerable gap between the proportion of men who are managers versus women who are managers. In 2017, 18% of men  held manager positions compared to 12% of women. Given that managers, on average, earn two times the salaries of non-managers, this gap contributes significantly to the overall gender wage gap. In 2016, Visier released a report on this phenomenon known as the </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/press-release/u-s-study-on-gender-pay-equity-discovers-new-key-to-closing-the-gender-wage-gap-the-manager-divide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manager Divide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\n\n<b>Methodology</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the core of Visier Insights reports is Visier’s unique database of anonymized, standardized workforce  data. For this Gender Equity Update, Visier targeted large US-based employers, leveraging a subset of Visier’s customer database, which included over 60 companies representing 1.5 million US-based employees.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies included in this report represent a wide range of industries, including Healthcare, Technology, Financial Services and Insurance, Energy and Manufacturing. For each of the included companies, Visier ensured a high degree of confidence in the data availability, quality for the topics and time period being covered by the report.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you have more ideas?

Present throughout the Visier People solution, Visier Benchmarks offer customers more timely, comprehensive, and relevant benchmarks than existing, government-sourced measures.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the Visier Technology Difference</span></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Underlying Visier People is Visier’s patented business analytics technology and development platform, operating in the cloud, which allows Visier to integrate data, and create and innovate analytics and planning applications much faster than possible with other technologies.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Visier Event Stream</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The number one challenge for other business analytics technologies is dealing with change: changing business questions that require new data queries and new data integration efforts. This drives considerable technical cost for companies, and slows down the pace at which leaders can make informed decisions about their business,” explained Ryan Wong, Visier’s co-founder,  president, and chief technology officer. “Visier’s technology was designed from the bottom up to handle change with ease and to treat time as a primary data element. Visier Event Stream, a core component of Visier’s technology, reconstructs data in memory on-the-fly, time-stamping it as it goes.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Visier loads data dynamically and handles the time dimension inherently, it is easy for Visier to answer new business questions. Instead of having to integrate and restructure data in a data warehouse, Visier simply defines a new business concept, in business terms. As a result, Visier is able to innovate and answer new questions for customers with unprecedented speed.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Visier Analytics and Planning Platform Extensibility</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Key to the Visier People value proposition is how we connect people data to business data, allowing our customers to answer truly business-shaping questions,” continued Wong. “Visier’s underlying  technology allows us to marry two or more classes of data, such as people and finance and sales data, with unheard-of ease. And because our machine learning algorithms are built into all our calculations, our customers gain insights not possible with other technologies, such as which processes or events positively or negatively influence a business outcome.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The result is Visier’s extraordinary potential to answer new and advanced questions for its customers, and to transform not just the domain of people analytics, but also other business areas.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Journalism</span></h4>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier also has designed its solutions with ease-of-use in mind. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Key to successful adoption of analytics is enabling business users to quickly understand the meaning and value of the insights being provided,” said Dave Weisbeck, Visier’s chief strategy officer. “With Visier People, Visier has made data journalism – the art and science of successfully telling stories with data – core to our delivery of explanatory analytics.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to offering in-depth exploratory analytics capabilities, which allow users to explore and ask questions of their data by leveraging hundreds of pre-built metrics and visualizations, Visier People also offers best practice explanatory analytics.

    Content:
      '<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big data analytics unlock the secret of how individuals progress at an organization</span></i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>SAN JOSE, CA and VANCOUVER, BC – May 24, 2018 —</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the recognized leader in people analytics and planning, announced Career Journeys, a first-of-its-kind capability – now  included in </span><a href="/solutions/talent/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier People® Talent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">– that analyzes the lifecycle of an organization’s people to answer important questions about the movement and development of talent. With Career Journeys, people managers can understand career mobility like never before, answering questions such as:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What intermediate roles should I consider to achieve my career goals?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which path is the quickest, and which is the most common?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How long does an individual typically stay in each role?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Millennials – the largest age cohort in the workforce today – have a bias towards mobility and expect career progression. Our own aggregated customer data shows that Millennial groups with higher rates of internal mobility, experience lower resignation rates,” says John Schwarz, Visier Co-Founder and CEO. “A key to retaining critical talent, therefore, is for managers to be able to articulate – with credibility – the career path for each individual. Career Journeys enables this.”</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class="size-full wp-image-29727 aligncenter" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Macbook_careerpath2.png" alt="Macbook_careerpath2" width="800" height="497" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier People’s Career Journeys analyzes an organization’s historic people data, and calculates the many routes employees have taken from one role to another. The outcome is a map of all the career paths taken within an organization, with insights into the fastest and most common paths.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Career Journeys, managers can now understand and share the potential career paths for each of their employees, allowing managers to have deeper, more productive career planning discussions,” explains Dave Weisbeck, Visier’s Chief Strategy Officer. “Managers no longer have to rely on intuition or guessing to better develop and engage critical talent.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span>\n<h3><b>About Visier</b></h3>\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      '<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Insights study finds Millennial managers resign two-thirds less often than and job hop internally 1.3 times as often as Millennial non-managers </span></i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>SAN JOSE, CA and VANCOUVER, BC – </b><b>June 7, 2018</b><b> —</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  A new study from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the recognized leader in people analytics and planning, illustrates the power of management titles, promotions, and internal job hopping on retaining Millennials.* </span><a href="https://hello.visier.com/retaining-millennials-visier-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Insights™: Retaining Millennials </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">published today, confirms the well-accepted view that Millennials resign more often, with a resignation rate that is nearly twice that of Non-Millennials (34.5 percent compared to 19.4 percent).** However, the report also shows the impact of career growth and mobility on Millennial resignation rates: Millennials who are managers resign nearly two-thirds less often and job hop internally 1.3 times as often as Millennials who are not managers.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennial employees now make up the largest share of the US workforce. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With employment numbers at an all time high and the war for talent more fierce than ever, organizations need to have a strategy to attract and retain Millennials,” said John Schwarz, Visier co-founder and CEO. “Our analysis confirmed that Millennials change jobs significantly more often</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it also uncovered the power of promotion as a key factor in motivating Millennials to stay with their firm. Our recommendation is: don\'t fight the tide—work with it. Give your brightest prospects places to go within your organization. Upward and lateral moves both work well. Millenials look for constant training and new challenges to feel they are progressing.”</span>\n\n<a href="https://hello.visier.com/retaining-millennials-visier-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Insights™ research report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be found here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes detailed findings and recommendations business leaders can take action on to retain Millennial workers. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The report findings were based on the Visier Insights database, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">an aggregated database of 1.5 million US-based employees from more than 60 companies (a subset of Visier’s customers). The Visier Insights study found:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The Manager Effect: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennials who are managers resign two-thirds less often than Millennials who are not managers (11.9 percent compared to 36.2 percent). The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manager Effect</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finds that an added sense of responsibility and career opportunity helps retain Millennial talent. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The Promotion Effect: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennial managers who have not received a promotion resign at a rate 5.2 percentage points higher than average, while Millennial managers who have been promoted in the last 24 months have a resignation rate that is 3.1 percentage points lower than average. Dubbed the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Promotion Effect</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Millennial managers expect more career growth, represented in promotions. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lack of promotion drives Millennial men to resign more than Millennial women: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millennial men who have not received  a promotion resign at a rate 1.7 percentage points higher than average, while Millennial women who have not been promoted resign at a rate that is only 0.7 percentage points lower than average.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Millennials job hop internally at the highest rates: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Millennials change jobs within a company almost twice as often as Non-Millennials (22 percent compared to 12 percent), with Millennial managers moving the most. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Gender bias in internal mobility:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Overall, male Millennials move internally 1.5 times as often as female Millennials; however, male and female Millennial managers have the same internal hire rate. A previous research report, Visier Insights: Gender Equity, identified the Manager Divide: a gender bias where women are increasingly underrepresented in manager roles during the key childcare years. Similarly, Millennial women are less likely to be hired into new roles internally. For Millennial women who overcome this bias by being promoted to manager roles, the benefits are both higher earning potential (because managers earn on average 2 times the salary of non-managers), and also more opportunity for internal movement.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The New Hire Effect:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Until around age 35, the new hire resignation rate decreases with increasing age, offset but following the same trend as the overall resignation rate. After age 35, the new hire resignation rate increases with age, while the overall resignation rate continues to drop. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Hire Effect </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">finds that workers of all ages are impacted by “newbie” issues (such as finding a new position does not meet their expectations, having a poor onboarding experience, or generally finding the company not to be a good culture fit); however, the challenges of integrating at a new workplace are more strongly felt by workers in their 50s and 60s, than those in their 30s and 40s.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*For this report, Millennials were those born in the year 1983 or later, and Non-Millennials were those born in the year 1982 or earlier.</span></i>\n\n<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">**Resignation rates for workers with up to 4 years of tenure. Resignation rates for workers of all tenure levels are 29.1 percent for Millennials and 9.2 percent for Non-Millennials.</span></i>\n<h3><b>Methodology</b></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the core of Visier Insights reports is Visier’s unique database of anonymized, standardized workforce  data. For the <em>Visier Insights™ Report: Retaining Millennials</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">report, Visier targeted large US-based employers, leveraging a subset of Visier’s customer database, which included over 60 companies representing 1.5 million US-based employees. For this report, workers were divided into two groups: Millennials (those born in 1983 or later) and Non-Millennials (those born in 1982 or before).</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies included in this report represent a wide range of industries, including Healthcare, Technology, Financial Services and Insurance, Energy and Manufacturing.

The survey was responded to by leaders with people analytics responsibilities, across a range of industries. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Developing a better understanding of the characteristics and leading practices of advanced organizations, as well as the value that these organizations derive from people analytics, is necessary for emerging organizations to make internal improvements and work toward maturity,” said Lexy Martin, Principal of Research and Customer Value at Visier and the author of the report. </span>\n\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-30766" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Age-of-People-Analytics-Figure-2-showing-the-four-stages-of-people-analytics-process-maturity-1-208x190.png" alt="Age of People Analytics Figure 2 showing the four stages of people analytics process maturity (1)" width="620" height="566" />\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The report offers an in-depth analysis of organizations with mature people analytics—known as “advanced” organizations—and compares the characteristics of these organizations with those just beginning their journey to maturity: “emerging” organizations. In addition to leading practices, the report also uncovers the financial advantages of more advanced use of People Analytics finding that advanced organizations in the survey outperform the emerging organizations on profit margins (56% higher) and return on assets (22% higher). </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey found that advanced organizations share the following traits:</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopt more people analytics solutions</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use more data sources and a wider range of analytics topics</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extend usage to more stakeholders within the organization and also have larger people analytics teams with more advanced roles</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foster a data-driven culture of decision-making through change management practices</span></li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a value chain analysis, this report shows that improvements through more solutions, data sources, analytics topics, user types and leading practices in change management predicts improved financial performance.</span>\n\n<a href="https://hello.visier.com/age-of-people-analytics-research-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The full </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be found here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes detailed findings and recommendations that organizations can take to derive greater benefits from People Analytics.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Findings: </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Advanced organizations are more sophisticated with the role that data plays in decision-making.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Respondents from these organizations more frequently use data to analyze the workforce proactively, make predictions, and create and monitor comprehensive workforce plans. The role of data in emerging organizations is not as robust: These organizations more frequently base decisions on operational reports and use data only for critical workforce decisions.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Across all organizations, the majority (54%) use people analytics to improve HR effectiveness today. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced organizations, however, more frequently rely on people analytics to improve business outcomes, but this is still not a common achievement. However, the fact that advanced organizations also more frequently report achieving labor cost savings further indicates their attention to obtaining better financial outcomes through people analytics.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Advanced organizations have more user types at higher levels within the organization. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, advanced organizations have 24% more users types. Increasing the number of users and user types, especially among executives and people managers, increases the variety of people using data to drive decision making. Ultimately, this can yield more results and greater value for an organization.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Advanced organizations report twice as many data sources than emerging organizations (4.8 vs. 2.4). </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These organizations include almost all data sources more frequently, with some sources such as talent management and employee engagement data included 20% or more frequently. This indicates that the analytics efforts of advanced organizations are strongly focused on the support of talent decisions. Financial data is the other data source more strongly integrated in advanced organizations, which enables these organizations to juxtapose business outcome measures with workforce data.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Advanced organizations establish an analytics Center of Excellence:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The advanced organizations adopt a COE 100% more frequently than emerging organizations. These centers typically support HR business partners, people leaders, and other HR centers of excellence for talent acquisition, development, and retention while freeing the analytics team to focus on more sophisticated analysis.</span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h3><b>Survey Demographics</b></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This survey, conducted between November 2017 and March 2018, targeted organizations that are either very or somewhat familiar with people analytics. The 259 respondents are from organizations representative of early adopters of HR technologies. The survey garnered a higher than representative response level from high-tech organizations, as well as very large organizations with more than 3,000 employees where business results are most differentiated by talent. These organizations are often the first to adopt new technologies. Being representative of early adopters, the findings from these respondents, particularly those assessed as “advanced,” are indicative of leading practices in adoption and worthy of attention by all organizations that are considering adopting people analytics.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

    Content:
      '<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier People’s delivers pre-built metrics for CEO Pay Ratio and Median Employee Pay</span></i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  – September 10, 2018 – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the recognized leader in people analytics and planning, today announced a powerful new capability in the latest quarterly release of its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier People®</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solution. The newest release of Visier People enables public companies to more easily meet new US government CEO Pay Ratio disclosure requirements,  with <a href="/blog/why-the-ceo-pay-ratio-proves-value-of-people-analytics/">pre-built metrics for CEO Pay Ratio and Median Employee Pay</a>. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting this year, public companies in the US are required to disclose new details on compensation in their annual proxy filings. This mandate from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act requires companies to report CEO compensation, median compensation of their employees, and the ratio between the two numbers – known as the CEO Pay Ratio.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The challenge of determining the CEO Pay Ratio is affecting organizations on two fronts: the efforts and costs of calculating it, and the optics of disclosing it,” said John Schwarz, Visier Founder and CEO. “In addition to saving companies a sizable expense associated with calculating this metric, Visier People provides leaders with a clear view of their workforce reality, enabling them to assess and prepare for the likely impact of the disclosure.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The practical efforts of calculating and communicating CEO Pay Ratio and Median Employee Pay metrics is</span><a href="https://www.visier.com/blog/ceo-pay-ratio-grade-school-math-or-grade-a-headache/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proving to be a complicated and expensive task for companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This complexity is due to several factors, including the presence of employee data in disparate pay systems; the wide variance in pay packages across employee categories; and the complexity of running calculations across millions of rows of data and determining the median of all of these separate data points. This task is beyond the capabilities of traditional Human Capital Management systems.  According to </span><a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/ceo-pay-ratio.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these challenges are costing organizations $100,000 or more per year in consulting fees to produce the number they need to report. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">New </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Median Employee Pay and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Pay metrics enable Visier People customers to calculate the ratio for their submission with a single click–-no expensive consultant required.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>Strategic Communication of CEO Pay Ratio with Visier People Data Journalism</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier People also enables organizations to more strategically communicate their CEO Pay Ratio by including context behind the number. For example, by including a breakdown of the type of employee, including seasonal and part-time employees, earnings by month, and compensation by job and using powerful data visualizations to illustrate these numbers, organizations can better explain the realities of their workforce and labor costs.  Each additional visual can be prefaced with an introduction so that the viewers are able to understand the bigger picture better. </span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<script src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/ml2mdoniaj.jsonp" async></script><script src="https://fast.wistia.com/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>\n<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0; position: relative;">\n<div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;">\n<div class="wistia_embed wistia_async_ml2mdoniaj videoFoam=true" style="height: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%;">\n<div class="wistia_swatch" style="height: 100%; left: 0; opacity: 0; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; top: 0; transition: opacity 200ms; width: 100%;"><img style="filter: blur(5px); height: 100%; object-fit: contain; width: 100%;" src="https://fast.wistia.com/embed/medias/ml2mdoniaj/swatch" alt="" aria-hidden="true" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

    Content:
      '<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future of people analytics: new What-If Analysis takes business value of people analytics to even higher levels</span></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA – September 11, 2018 —</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the recognized leader in people analytics and planning, announced an innovative new analytic capability the company will be demonstrating at </span><a href="http://www.hrtechnologyconference.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HR Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the world’s largest HR technology conference, taking place September 11-13: answering “what if” questions about the future that factor in and compare different decision paths. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, analytic technologies have focused on answering questions about what has happened in the past, what is happening today, and – using predictive methods – what is likely to happen in the future. However, most have not addressed what will happen </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a certain action is taken or change is made. For instance, what will happen to top performer resignation rates </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they are given a pay raise of 4 percent instead of 6 percent; how much will an organization save in labor costs </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchange rates decrease; or, what will an enterprise’s diversity distribution be at the end of of the year</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the female hire rate is increased by 2 percent. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our customers have shown us that one of their most powerful uses of Visier People is when it is used in live interactive decision-making conversations with leaders,” said Adam Binnie, Visier’s Chief Product Officer. “In particular, when leaders are discussing the different actions an organization could take to solve problems or drive better outcomes. We have now developed a capability that will enable our customers to do just that: to explore different actions and compare their likely outcomes.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The science around talent has been heading toward this moment, being able to explore the options around people choices and confidently choose a path. Choices that unlock competitive advantage through people -- it\'s what will separate the winners from the losers. Any HR function operating without people analytics is, in essence, guessing -- and that’s not a good place to be,” said Paul Rubenstein, Visier’s Chief People Officer. “Visier’s new What If capability means our customers will be able to test different options, plan better talent choices, and advance HR’s ability to make commercial contribution to the business. ”</span>\n\n<img class="alignnone wp-image-31145" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/What-if.png" alt="What if" width="800" height="515" />\n\n<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier’s What-If Analysis enables users to adjust the assumptions to review the impact of business changes</span></i>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier will deploy the new What If capability in a number of best practice analyses, which will be available “out of the box” in Visier People.

Our culture is the collective effort of every employee at Visier in Canada and across the world.

Employers are evaluated by the editors at Canada\'s Top 100 Employers using the same criteria as the Top 100 competition: (1) Physical Workplace; (2) Work Atmosphere &amp; Social; (3) Health, Financial &amp; Family Benefits; (4) Vacation &amp; Time Off; (5) Employee Communications; (6) Performance Management; (7) Training &amp; Skills Development; and (8) Community Involvement. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The companies that make this list are fast-growing employers that need to innovate rapidly,” says Richard Yerema, Managing Editor of the Canada’s Top 100 Employers project. “Some have doubled in size over the past year, but all of them are looking for new ways to attract the best and brightest employees so they can keep growing. Many compete in high technology fields, where the race to scale-up isn’t just a matter of ambition – it’s a matter of survival.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier maintains a leading-edge workplace by investing in culture and people through learning programs, career growth, company outings, comprehensive benefits and perks, and a team environment.

    Content:
      '<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer interviews reveal thousands of hours of labor saved per year </span></i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">VANCOUVER, BC </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">– April 18, 2019 — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the globally recognized leader in people analytics and planning, released today a third-party report conducted by </span><a href="https://nucleusresearch.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an information technology research firm specializing in investigative research and the return on investment analysis of technology deployments. The report, which was based on a series of interviews Nucleus Research conducted with Visier customers, uncovered a number of tangible business benefits for both HR and the IT departments.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In conversations with HCM professionals and other Visier users, Nucleus Research found that customers selected Visier because of its <a href="/solutions/">all-in-one people analytics solution</a>, Visier’s strong customer service, and because Visier allowed users to focus on analysis, by removing the need to perform administrative tasks. Nucleus Research found that Visier customers were able to achieve productivity gains for both IT and analytics users, while the solution also easily scaled to help support organizational growth. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Visier offers a pre-built, enterprise solution for people analytics that requires limited IT investment to implement and maintain. As a result, IT and analytics teams are able to spend less time doing low business value tasks, like preparing and integrating data, and more time performing high-value analysis work,” said Trevor White, Senior Analyst for Nucleus Research. “Additionally, Visier’s all-inclusive SAAS model means that, as organizations grow, they can easily scale the use of Visier, while avoiding new investments in IT. As the amount and complexity of HR data grows, scalability will be a key benefit driver for organizations using analytics solutions. Visier’s ease of scalability provides a clear differentiator that provides consistent value to users.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nucleus Research found that one of Visier’s primary benefits to the IT department is the ability to scale the Visier solution (with new data, new analytics, new users) without the need to invest in expanding a team of costly Data Scientists. With the average Data Scientist hire greater than $130,000 a year and in short supply, this provided strong direct savings to Visier customers. As well, Visier customers reported significant improvements in IT and analyst productivity.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the departmental benefits, Nucleus Research found Visier customers had experienced positive business results. In one customer experience, the organization reported that use of Visier people analytics enabled them to reduce turnover by over 60 percent in just six months, which led to millions of dollars in savings.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The report was conducted by Nucleus Research, through interviews with current Visier customers.</span>\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      '<h2><em>Visier’s D&amp;I analytics solution gives C-Suites, Boards, and D&amp;I Leaders On Demand Access to the Insights Needed to Progress their Strategic Initiatives</em></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\nVANCOUVER, BC and SAN FRANCISCO – <strong>May 7, 2019</strong> — Visier, the globally recognized leader in people analytics and planning, today released <a href="https://www.visier.com/solutions/diversity/">Visier People™: Diversity and Inclusion</a>,an analytics solution that provides executives comprehensive up-to-date visibility into the state of diversity and inclusion within their organization. The new SaaS solution enables leaders to identify opportunities and risks and make informed decisions toward achieving their organization’s D&amp;I goals.\n\nFor nearly ten years, Visier customers have utilized Visier’s core HR analytics solutions  as part of their broader diversity strategy, uncovering valuable insights about their workforces. With the launch of Visier People™: Diversity and Inclusion, Visier now offers a solution designed for Chief Diversity Officers and leaders to utilize insights to further their mandate to set and execute on a D&amp;I strategy.\n\n“The best organizations know that Diversity and Inclusion efforts are the right thing to do for society and for the growth and sustainability of their business,” said Paul Rubenstein, Chief People Officer of Visier. “Yet the majority of organizations still struggle to turn their aspirations into achievements. We built Visier’s D&amp;I analytics solution to close the gap between setting goals and taking action. Companies can put meaningful insights in everyone’s hands. Change happens when it’s easy for everyone to see the richness of a company’s talent. Visibility is a critical step to leveling the playing field as we strive for objective, informed choices about interviewing, hiring and promotion.”\n\nMany Boards and C-Suites have made Diversity and Inclusion  a leading business priority, and as such, have joined coalitions of companies committed to taking specific actions towards their goals, including regular measurement and analysis of their state of D&amp;I.\n\nThe majority of these companies employ a Chief Diversity Officer, whose role is to understand the demographics of their workforce and improve the dynamics of their organization. However, according to research conducted by <a href="https://www.russellreynolds.com/insights/thought-leadership/a-leaders-guide-finding-and-keeping-your-next-chief-diversity-officer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell Reynolds Associates</a> only 35 percent of Chief Diversity Officers say they have employee demographic data, leaving the majority without hard numbers to support their work.

      '<b>VANCOUVER, BC and NEW YORK– June 11, 2019</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the globally recognized leader in people analytics and planning, today announced a data integration with </span><a href="https://www.trustsphere.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TrustSphere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the market leader in Relationship Analytics and Organizational Network Analysis (ONA). Through this collaboration, ONA metrics can now be viewed alongside broader people analytics data to add a new dimension to an organization’s workforce insights.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the TrustSphere integration, Visier customers can now make better decisions based on previously difficult to obtain relationship network metrics, combined with other HR data. Deeper, network insights provide the context to identify hidden talent, key influencers and enable smarter strategic workforce planning.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“ONA has emerged as one of the hottest topics in HR right now, and for good reason. Without it, the people who truly deserve to be recognized within an organization can be overlooked,” said Ian Cook, Vice President of People Solutions  at Visier. “When a solid ONA premise is combined with the multi-dimensional people analysis of Visier, companies gain powerful and actionable insights that drive much better talent decisions.”</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Manish Goel, CEO of TrustSphere, shared, “We’ve all heard the saying ‘it’s not what you know, rather it’s  who you know’. The science behind TrustSphere’s ONA technology measures how employees build and maintain their relationship networks and social capital. This is providing powerful workforce insights in high-potentials selection, leadership development, succession planning and diversity and inclusion. Our partnership enables Visier customers to transform their strategic workforce planning initiatives using powerful new analytics and insights. Together this allows organizations to better develop and manage their most important talent.”</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining ONA with people analytics can also provide meaningful insights into the effectiveness of organizational diversity and inclusion initiatives. ONA can show D&amp;I leaders if employees - and their managers - are building networks that foster inclusion and enable diverse employees to reach their potential. A comprehensive understanding of the relationships built, and the associated hiring, promotions and retention rates of those employees can help companies build the right internal networks for equal promotion opportunities.</span>\n\n<img class="aligncenter wp-image-36486 size-full" src="https://www.visier.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Data-visualization-showing-the-relationship-network-effects-by-organization.jpg" alt="Data visualization showing the relationship network effects by organization" width="1101" height="621" />\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier’s ONA capabilities are now available, further information about the benefits of ONA can be found on a recent </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/blog/what-the-union-of-ona-and-people-analytics-means/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

The report found that not only have Visier customers beat the market in retaining talent overall by 3.5%, but they had experienced a reduction in manager turnover by a combined 17%, resulting in millions of dollars of cost savings.</span>\n\n<a href="https://hello.visier.com/people-analytics-drives-manager-turnover-reduction/"><b>Download Visier’s Manager Turnover Report </b></a>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of manager turnover is significant and includes not only the direct costs to hire replacements, but also the lost productivity while new managers are coming up to speed, as well as the lost revenue or impact on profit while a position is vacant. Taking into consideration these costs, the report found organizations with approximately 10,000 employees, and a hypothetical average overall turnover rate of 15%, will achieve over $4.5 Million dollars in savings as a result of retaining more managers thanks to interventions developed as the result of insights from Visier.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Turnover, especially from a manager level or above, can be a significant expense for organizations of all sizes,” said John Schwarz, CEO of Visier. “What this report shows is that Visier customers have been successful in identifying specific at risk employee populations, and implementing strategies to retain and develop that talent rather than see it disappear. In a job market with historic low unemployment rates, retaining top talent is critical to the competitive success of an organization.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier compiled the report using anonymized customer data, which included more than 20 enterprise companies representing over 600,000 employees.

At the end of 2018, women occupied 32% of leadership roles (manager-level and above) group-wide at the organization, which means that it exceeded its 2021 target of maintaining a 30% representation of women in these positions. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple studies cited in the report found concrete benefit in having a diverse leadership portfolio. McKinsey’s research shows companies in the top quartile for gender diversity on their executive teams are 21% more likely to experience above-average profitability than companies in the fourth quartile. Specific to female leadership, organizations with a high number of women in leadership positions see a 34% total higher return to shareholders than those that do not. And, while not specifically the result of having more women, companies increasing the diversity of their leadership teams experience more and better innovation and improved financial performance–19% higher revenue due to innovation. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The full report findings show that organizations focusing on female participation in management levels and taking corrective actions for improvement see movement towards parity in representation, as well as more inclusion and fairer pay. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The full report can be found </span><a href="https://hello.visier.com/people-analytics-improves-female-leadership-ratio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\nVisier’s purpose is to help people see the truth and create a better future—now.\n\nVisier was founded to focus on what matters to business people: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

This is the stepping stone to offer Visier Cloud as a complete open ecosystem, where creative new applications built from our analytics foundation will help global organizations see the truth in their data.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhanced platform capabilities now allow technology partners to onboard, model, and design their own data. Visier also announced 15 new solutions in collaboration with partners covering various business use cases for employee experience and workforce productivity. These new capabilities within Visier People are designed to empower organizations to support and develop their people. Updates include:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Monitor your organization: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twelve pre-built analyses designed to provide dense, summarized views of key business concerns giving executives and leaders a quick overview of the state of their business and what may or may not need attention. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cohort analysis:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Track custom created cohorts of people over time to measure the impact of shared experience on outcomes.

      '<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier recognized as going above and beyond in giving back to the community during times of crisis</span></i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– September 23, 2020 – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier, the recognized leader in people analytics, today announced that TrustRadius has recognized the company with a 2020 Tech Cares Award. This award celebrates companies that have gone above and beyond to provide their communities, clients, and front line workers with support during the COVID-19 crisis. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">"COVID-19 took the entire world by surprise, and while it has been a critical health crisis, it has also become a people crisis with impacts ranging from job safety to employment security," said Ryan Wong, CEO of Visier. “I am proud of how rapidly our team responded in finding ways to support not only our customers, but the broader business community at large, to help keep their people healthy, safe, and secure.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a matter of weeks, Visier shipped a new product update designed to understand critical health risks and hot spots, which was made free to all customers and the data made publicly available on Github. In addition, a weekly webinar series provided a community forum to discuss the challenges being faced by COVID-19 and what solutions were being found for the common good.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are excited to announce our first-ever Tech Cares Award Winners,” said TrustRadius CEO Vinay Bhagat. “This pandemic isn’t just a test of fortitude. It\'s an opportunity to distinguish yourself. We have been completely inspired by the way the B2B technology industry responded to COVID-19. So many companies pivoted with grace, leading to many of them standing out in our minds as major community contributors during this time. Not only do we feel that these companies are deserving of recognition—we also consider their example when deciding how we ourselves can find new ways to give back.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To be accepted for the Tech Cares Award, each nominated organization had to be a B2B technology company that demonstrated above-and-beyond caring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone was welcome to nominate an organization for this award, including those who work for or with the company.

      "New Visier Report Finds Women Much Less Likely to Succeed Male Executives in Leadership Roles",
    Content:
      '<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As cracks in glass ceiling start to appear, Visier’s report shows more progress is needed to close the gender gap in upper management roles</span></i></h2>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– October 12, 2020 – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the recognized leader in people analytics, today announced the findings from its “</span><a href="https://hello.visier.com/glass-ceiling-visier-insights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier Insights™: Cracks in the Glass Ceiling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” report. Supported by Visier People® benchmark data, with over 10 Million employee records, the report focuses on the movement of men and women into management roles, specifically looking at the gender disparity in hiring, internal movement, and succession planning.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings uncover the dynamics of gender replacement during hiring and internal movement, and how these activities contribute to ensuring equitable female representation on leadership teams. In the report, Visier findings reveal that women are much less likely to succeed a male than men are to succeed a female in upper management, despite the fact that females are replacing males at higher rates in lower management levels. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been proven that empowering women to pursue leadership roles sparks greater economic growth, productivity, innovation and trust at organizations across the globe,” said Lexy Martin, Head of Research at Visier. “While our findings show some promising progress towards gender equality in the workplace, we need to see a greater increase in women replacing men in leadership roles to truly move the needle. To break the glass ceiling that continues to hinder women’s growth, leaders need to approach improvement as they would any business imperative.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Key findings from the report include: </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>There are cracks, but the glass ceiling isn’t shattered yet</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – In 19 organizations analyzed by Visier, 27 women left their vice president or senior director/director roles. 52% percent of this group were replaced by women, while 48% were replaced by men. In the same organizations, 579 men left their vice president or senior director/director roles. 75% percent were replaced by men while 25% were replaced by women – a finding that shows men typically fill vacant senior management roles previously held by a man. </span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Gender equality is improving at lower management levels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Visier found statistical evidence that females are moving upwards in replacing males, especially in lower management roles, indicating upcoming cracks in the glass ceiling. Visier compared the state of replacees in 44 organizations between March and June of 2020 to the past three years, and found that since the beginning of March, females have replaced males and females at higher rates than in 2016-2019. From 2017-2019, 8,109 men left their manager positions. Of them, 28% were replaced by women and 72% were replaced by men. Between March and June 2020, 656 men left their manager positions. Of them, 35% were replaced by women and 65% were replaced by men. The percentage of females replacing males increased by 25% over this time period, marking a significant change in closing the gender gap within corporations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the quantitative findings, Visier’s report recommends three data-driven steps organizations should take to showcase the importance of promoting female equality as a company-wide initiative to their CEOs. To see real change in female representation, organizations should create a comprehensive D&amp;I strategy supported with data, apply data across the employee lifecycle and hold employees accountable for breaking barriers.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shattering the glass ceiling has been a core issue for decades, but it doesn’t have to be with the right leadership and approach,” said Martin. “Establishing a data-driven plan for improving gender equality in leadership roles and ensuring your CEO is onboard with the improvement agenda is critical. Our report arms organizations with the insights needed to elevate more women on their staff to management roles.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To access the full report, click </span><a href="https://hello.visier.com/glass-ceiling-visier-insights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

      "Research Shows Causal Link between People Analytics and Higher Financial Performance",
    Content:
      '<p><em>New book by noted academics and researchers does the math on people analytics, proving the value generated by organizations employing people analytics</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>VANCOUVER, BC – April 20, 2021</strong> — <a href="/">Visier</a>, the globally recognized leader in people analytics and planning, unveiled research today showing the causal link between people analytics and associated best practices in improving the business performance of enterprise organizations. The research is featured in a new book from the Routledge publishing house. HR leaders and people managers should see this as declarative proof--the open-and-shut case--for the critical importance of data-driven approaches to managing a workforce at scale.</p>\n\n<p>This research comes at a time when HR leaders and people managers are facing a perfect storm of challenges related to a global pandemic and newly distributed teams; a reckoning on race, equality and diversity; and a talent crisis that has made recruiting and retention harder than ever before. Without a robust strategy for people analytics, HR leaders and people managers are flying blind--and missing opportunities for substantial business advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Evidence to this effect can be found in this newly published book, <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Digitalised-Talent-Management-Navigating-the-Human-Technology-Interface/Wiblen/p/book/9780367211066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digitalised Talent Management: Navigating the Human Technology Interface</a>, which outlines the value of people analytics through joint research conducted by Janet H. Marler, Phd., Professor of Management at the University of Albany and Lexy Martin, Principal Research at Visier. </p>\n\n<p>Marler/Martin’s statistically proven research validates that organizations stronger in people analytics and associated practices, have stronger financial performance--at least 7% greater in return on assets and 8% in profit margin. </p>\n\n<p>“We’ve had plenty of research in the past that shows the correlation between higher financial performance and the adoption of people analytics. What the Marler/Martin analysis shows is there is a causal link between the adoption of people analytics and higher financial performance,” said Martin. “Visier’s own research found organizations that are advanced in their use of people analytics and a set of adoption practices have consistently outperformed their peers in using analytics to improve retention, employee satisfaction, diversity and inclusion, and talent acquisition. This work, plus the broader use by people managers, integration of financial data, and use of change management contribute to an overall economic advantage, with the financial improvement proving to be quite significant.”</p>\n\n<p>The Marler/Martin findings extend a 2020 research <a href="https://hello.visier.com/financial-impact-people-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study</a> conducted by Visier on the Financial Impact of People Analytics. In the report, Visier found that customers employing people analytics strategies were outperforming their peers in both return on equity and revenue per employee. The report found the average return on equity across all industry sectors in the U.S. was 15.4%, however for publicly-traded Visier customers, the average return on equity was 23.6%, more than 50% higher. Similarly, Visier customers generated an average of $125,000 more revenue per employee, resulting in $775,364 per employee, against an average of $650,797.</p>\n\n<p>“The need for people analytics increased dramatically over the past year, with more organizations looking to understand their people—and the subsequent financial impact of those people—better,” said Stacia Garr, Co-founder and Principal Analyst at RedThread Research. “This research draws a very clear line between the adoption of people analytics and improved financial impacts, which is what we would expect, given how high-quality information about people can lead to much better decision-making.”</p>\n\n<p>Martin will be hosting an expert <a href="https://hello.visier.com/financial-impact-webinar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roundtable discussion</a> on the impact people analytics has throughout an organization, and the bottom line impact on May 25, 2021 at 9am PST. She will be joined by Visier’s Chief People Officer, Paul Rubenstein; Chief Strategy Officer, Dave Weisbeck and Vice President of People Analytics, Ian Cook.</p>\n\n<p>The Digitised Talent Management: Navigating the Human Technology Interface is available for purchase <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Digitalised-Talent-Management-Navigating-the-Human-Technology-Interface/Wiblen/p/book/9780367211066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

    Title: "Visier Data Uncovers Employee Resignations are on the Rise",
    Content:
      '<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations not focused on retention are at risk of higher attrition, especially in Healthcare and Technology</span></i></p>\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC – June 11, 2021</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the globally recognized leader in people analytics and planning, today unveiled new data findings that signal a significant shift in employee behavior leading into the summer months. According to the data, not even a pandemic could keep people from leaving, and for a major chunk of the market, resignations have actually increased. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the “</span><a href="https://www.visier.com/blog/trends-in-employee-resignation-rates-watch-out-for-summer-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resignation Wave</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” the Visier study found that during the summer months, organizations have consistently seen year-high resignation rates peaking between the months of June to September. Even during the height of the pandemic in 2020, employees continued to shift job roles during the same periods. Current 2021 data shows the resignation trend is rising earlier than previous years, indicating there has been a build-up of overdue resignations, signaling a higher than average year for resignations across all industries.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Resignations are particularly acute for technology and healthcare, with the increased stress of burnout and overtime impacting those sectors over the past year and a half.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier’s data is validated by the most recent BLS </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which  for the month of April showed a 20 year high in quit rates.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This data is inline with previous </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/blog/women-on-the-move-new-survey-uncovers-urgent-need-to-empower-female-leaders-in-todays-workforce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which indicated women in the workforce are exiting at alarming rates, with 30% of women considering leaving the workforce, and over 40% of female managers considering an exit.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Organizations need to take a hard look at their retention strategies coming out of last year,” said Ian Cook, VP People Analytics at Visier. “Employers may have an unfounded belief that the pandemic caused employees to reconsider leaving their jobs due to market uncertainty, which is clearly not the case. If employees were comfortable exiting during the height of the pandemic, this year could prove to be a year of unprecedented change.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information about Visier’s leading people analytics solution, visit </span><a href="http://www.visier.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.visier.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier is the recognized global leader in people analytics and workforce planning.  Founded in 2010 by the pioneers of business intelligence, Visier focuses on what matters to business leaders: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      "More Than Half of UK Financial Services Workers Plan to Change Jobs in the Next Year, shows Visier Study",
    Content:
      '<b>LONDON, 23 JUNE 2021 - </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research commissioned by people analytics company Visier reveals that more than half of financial services employees in the UK expect to actively look for jobs outside their current company in the next 12 months - with almost a quarter (24 percent) already looking for new jobs, suggesting a potential peak season of resignations in the sector. Of employees actively considering changing jobs, as many as six in ten (62 percent) say they are considering moving into a new sector or career altogether. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While the vast majority of UK financial services workers (77 percent) said they felt well supported by their employer during the last year and 72 percent said they would recommend their company as a place to work, the major reasons for seeking a new role are poor work/life balance (43 percent), salary (33 percent), feeling unvalued (25 percent) and not being encouraged to learn new skills (19 percent).</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Skills training clearly plays an important role in job satisfaction. Over half of financial services employees (55 percent) said they are worried that their career will stall if they do not develop more skills. As many as 55 percent of workers said their workload impacts their ability to train and learn new skills that could further their career. Only 59 percent said they are confident their employer is bringing in the right people to keep pace with clients\' expectations for digital services. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This concern is shared by HR leaders in financial services. The vast majority (84 per cent) feel there are significant skills issues within their business and when looking for new candidates. More than two-thirds believe that the sector’s lack of available candidates is holding back their company’s digital transformation strategy. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“An employee\'s work life balance and salary has always been a driving factor for moments of change in jobs and careers. However, we are increasingly seeing the consequence that a lack of skills training is having on an individual\'s career and we are not surprised to see that many are concerned about the impact it will have for future employment and personal growth,” said </span><b>Daniel Mason, Vice President EMEA of Visier</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “As financial services businesses go through yet more upheaval to the ways they are used to working, they need to be conscious of other factors that can impact the retention rate of their employees, and in addressing the skills gap head-on to drive digital transformation.”</span>\n\n<b>Rob Etheridge, MD and Global Head of Workforce Management and Analytics at Deutsche Bank</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said: “The FS sector is working through a significant skills shortage, so it is concerning to see a large proportion of FS employees are considering leaving their role as this will continue to broaden the skills gap within the industry. At Deutsche Bank, we have invested in workforce insight tools to better understand workforce dynamics, which is especially important given recent changes in employee working habits and expectations. As part of this approach, we are focusing on the skills profile of the organisation and how we can leverage insights to positively impact talent retention and job satisfaction.”</span>\n\n<i>For a deeper dive into the research and to read more about the impact of skills on financial services job satisfaction, and the power of workforce data in helping organisations rise to the challenge, check out the full Visier Report on “<a href="https://hello.visier.com/financial-services-skills-challenge.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hello.visier.com/financial-services-skills-challenge.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626365113943000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjzo_HhZeZBelyYHX_boB_Dw4HTg"><b>Addressing the Financial Services Skills Crisis Through People Analytics</b></a>”.</i>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">###</span>\n\n<b>Research methodology </b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Research of 1,003 employees of financial services companies in the UK and 250 HR employees working in the financial sector in the UK was conducted by independent research company Censuswide between 17-24 May 2021. </span>\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier is the recognized global leader in people analytics and workforce planning.  Founded in 2010 by the pioneers of business intelligence, Visier focuses on what matters to business leaders: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

This investment signals a historic moment in the growth of the people analytics market, with Visier becoming the first independent vendor in the space to reach a $1 billion valuation.  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is unprecedented demand for companies to better understand the people within their organizations,” said Ryan Wong, CEO of Visier. “From HR leaders to people managers and executives, having insight into a workforce is critical for delivering the right outcomes for the business, the employee, the customer, and a fair and just society.” </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The partnership with Goldman Sachs on the next phase of Visier’s growth underscores the fact that people analytics has become mainstream business practice,” said John Schwarz, Co-Founder and Chairman of Visier. “This investment is key to establishing Visier as the independent global cloud platform for people related business insights.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies are in the midst of a swift and massive transformation due to the increased demand placed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on organizations to better know, care for, and support their employees, while also driving the best possible performance for the business. From SEC regulations requiring more data and transparency on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">diversity, equity and inclusion to the rapid shift to a remote workforce brought on by the pandemic, the need for people analytics has never been more pressing. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Access to information about employees and the health of an organization has never been more critical,” said Holger Staude, managing director within Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We’re excited to partner with Visier at this pivotal moment and support the company’s continued growth.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">To spearhead this new era of people analytics, Visier will use the funding to extend and accelerate product development and international go to market expansion. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This funding announcement comes after a landmark quarter for Visier. The company recently <a href="https://www.visier.com/press-release/visier-surpasses-7000-customers-accelerates-momentum-as-the-leader-in-people-analytics-and-planning/">announced</a> passing the 8,000 customer mark, along with signing embedded partnership agreements with Cegid, PeopleFluent and Degreed. As of 2021, Visier processes over 12 million employee records in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">75 countries around the world, with enterprise customers that include Adobe, BASF, Bridgestone, Electronic Arts, McKesson, Merck KGaA, Uber and more.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier has previously raised $94.5M USD in four funding rounds, bringing the company’s total funding to $219.5M. Goldman Sachs joins existing investors Sorenson Capital, Foundation Capital, Summit Partners, and Adams Street Partners.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">With this investment, Visier joins an elite list of HR technology providers to have raised more than $100M in a single funding round; the Vancouver-based company also joins the exclusive ranks of Canadian unicorns like Clio, Wealthsimple, Thinkific, Trulioo and more.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">LionTree Advisors served as financial advisor and Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP served as legal advisor to Visier.

      "New Report Reveals Substantial Levels of Racial and Ethnic Disparity in the Workplace",
    Content:
      '<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier data highlights the need for decades of systemic change in order to achieve equity</span></i></p>\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC – July 13, 2021</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the globally recognized leader in people analytics and planning, today unveiled new data highlighting the sheer magnitude of equity imbalance when it comes to race and ethnicity in the workforce. The new report titled “</span><a href="https://www.visier.com/racial-ethnic-career-gap-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racial/Ethnic Career Gap Reveals Magnitude of Equity Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” presents new data detailing the significant career progression and pay gaps that exist in today’s workforce.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Visier study uncovered the uncomfortable truth that today’s workforce is simply not living up to the standards discussed in the broader public forum. Currently, underrepresented groups make less than $0.86 cents to the dollar of their white counterparts, a statistic even more dire for Black employees, in particular, who average less than $0.67 to the dollar. By reviewing the pay equity progress made over the last three years, Visier estimates it would take more than 25 years for underrepresented groups to reach pay parity--and a shocking 78 years for Black employees.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major contributing causes to this pay disparity is the lack of opportunities made available to underrepresented groups in management roles. Visier’s data found fewer underrepresented groups being promoted to management positions, and receiving those promotions later in their careers, leading to a pay gap seemingly impossible to close.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“This data should be a wake up call to employers that have publicly pledged to improve their diversity, equity and inclusion goals in support of movements such as Black Lives Matter,” said Lexy Martin, Principal of Research at Visier. “Action, not words, are what cause real change. The data we’ve uncovered shows that there is a problem, but not an unsolvable one. Armed with data, organizations can take concrete actions to correct the imbalances in their workplaces, and hopefully expedite the path to an equitable society.”</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As tremendous and complex as these challenges are, employers are not powerless to address them. The data shows that strides have been made in narrowing the gender pay gap in recent years indicating that it is possible to move the needle on outcomes through concerted efforts.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to the full report can be found </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/racial-ethnic-career-gap-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information about Visier’s leading people analytics solution, visit </span><a href="http://www.visier.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.visier.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier is the recognized global leader in people analytics and workforce planning.  Founded in 2010 by the pioneers of business intelligence, Visier focuses on what matters to business leaders: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      "Viser and Out in Tech Partner to Increase Opportunities for LGBTQ+ Tech Talent",
    Content:
      '<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier becomes member of Qorporate, Out in Tech’s corporate council</span></i>\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC – July 29, 2021</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the globally recognized leader in people analytics and planning,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is proud to announce its partnership with Out in Tech, the world’s largest community of LGBTQ+ tech professionals that seeks greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a member of Qorporate, a membership program for companies committed to improving opportunities for LGBTQ+ people and other underrepresented groups in tech, Visier will join more than three dozen companies looking to drive workplace belonging. Other members of Qorporate include Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Disney (NYSE: DIS), Nike (NYSE: NKE), PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) and Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP).</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruiting and retaining women, people of color and LGBTQ+ people – especially tech talent – is one of the biggest human resources challenges facing companies today. While most large tech companies have established diversity and inclusion programs, technology startups often lack the scale at which diversity initiatives are a priority or employee resource groups can be formed.  Visier and Out in Tech will collaborate on expanding a peer network for sharing best practices, exploring emerging topics in workplace belonging, and peer consulting on related initiatives.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“When it comes to diversity in tech, forty minds are better than one,” said Andrew Lowenthal, executive director of Out in Tech. “By weaving together the collective experiences of our founding members, we will shine a light on what’s working, push the envelope with new ideas, and create more equitable and inclusive workplaces for all underrepresented groups.  We’re thrilled to have Visier as our newest member.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a 2017 </span><a href="https://www.kaporcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/TechLeavers2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Kapor Center for Social Impact, LGBTQ employees were most likely to be bullied and experience public humiliation or embarrassment, both at significantly higher rates than non-LGBTQ employees. Qorporate brings together LGBTQ+ employee group leaders, talent acquisition professionals, and other HR leaders from across the USA and UK to help all companies, regardless of size, recruit and retain employees from underrepresented groups, and take an intersectional approach to creating a culture of belonging.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">\n</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Creating a culture where everyone can do their best work is critical to our success. You can’t be an authentic leader in the HR Technology space without being a leader in creating a diverse and equitable workplace.  Visier doesn’t just help other companies with D&amp;I, we are committed to leading by example,” said Paul Rubenstein, Chief People Officer of Visier. “We are proud to support Out in Tech, and we look forward to doing great things together.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Qorporate member companies receive early invitations to major Out in Tech events and conferences, a private virtual community for council delegates, and priority access to speaking opportunities and partnerships around the world. In addition, a job board connects LGBTQ+ candidates with job listings from Qorporate member companies that are actively seeking to build a stronger pipeline of diversity for the future.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2013, Out in Tech now has more than 40,000 members in 17 cities globally, including Austin, Bengaluru, Boston, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, and more. Out in Tech volunteers have collectively devoted over 10,000 hours to help groups fighting for LGBTQ+ equality worldwide and to mentor LGBTQ+ identifying youth.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information about Out in Tech and joining Qorporate, visit </span><a href="http://outintech.com/qorporate"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outintech.com/qorporate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier is the recognized global leader in people analytics and workforce planning.  Founded in 2010 by the pioneers of business intelligence, Visier focuses on what matters to business leaders: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      "Visier and Emsi Partner to Create Unified Labor Market Insights for Business Leaders",
    Content:
      '<em>The partnership brings millions of employee records under a common job classification system</em>\n\n<strong>VANCOUVER, BC and SAN JOSE, CA</strong> – October 27, 2020 – <a href="http://www.visier.com">Visier</a>, the recognized leader in people analytics and planning, today announced a new partnership with <a href="https://www.economicmodeling.com/">Emsi</a>, who provide the best labor market data available to professionals. This partnership creates a new standard for labor market insights, allowing Visier customers to utilize Emsi data to bring much needed standardization to job classifications.\n“Organizations are facing increased pressure from investors, shareholders, employees and the public in being more transparent about their people,” said Ryan Wong, CEO of Visier. “Companies are struggling to find a common language to address metrics like diversity and inclusion, talent acquisition, retention, skills and career development. Without a common means of addressing all of these issues, little progress can be made. By partnering with Emsi, our customers can now all speak the same language when it comes to job roles and skills inventory.”\n\n“Our mission is to use data to drive economic prosperity for individuals. Accomplishing this requires the creation and deployment of Emsi Skills and Titles to deliver on that promise,” said Andrew Crapuchettes, CEO of Emsi. “For the longest time, we’ve known a common language for skills and titles was needed to help organizations deploy better talent attraction, retention, and mobility strategies.

When the ecosystem embraces integrated pathways and a more seamless user experience, employees win!"\n\n“The combination of Visier and EMSI has tremendous potential.

      "Visier Launches “Visier NOW,” New Packaged Solutions Targeting the Most Urgent Workforce Challenges",
    Content:
      '<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready-to-Deploy Solutions Target Employee Turnover Crisis and Workforce Diversity Imbalance as Among the Most Pressing Enterprise Challenges Today</span></i>\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><b> August </b><b>24</b><b>, 2021</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span><a href="http://www.visier.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the globally recognized leader in people analytics and planning, today announced </span><b>Visier NOW™</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new family of purpose-built packaged solutions. Designed to specifically address today’s urgent workforce challenges, the suite of Visier NOW solutions includes:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI-powered analytics and planning tools trusted by the world’s most recognizable brands.  </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-built questions, analytics models, and best practices targeted to a specific challenge.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whiteglove implementation and tailored support services.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Available today, Visier NOW launches with two ready-to-deploy solutions:</span>\n\n<b>Retention Focus</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">--an expertly designed managed service that provides an early warning system for retention risks, the specific drivers of employee turnover, and the tools for heading off employee exits. This packaged solution lets HR leaders, people managers, and executives get ahead of employee resignations and associated staffing issues before they happen. Using Visier’s proven AI-powered analytics, this solution answers crucial questions including:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which of my highest performing employees are likely to churn?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the causes of retention risks across the organization?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which initiatives will have the most impact in helping to retain our best talent?  </span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The resignation wave is very real, with 20-40% of employees actively considering quitting their jobs,” said Paul Rubenstein, Chief People Officer at Visier. “The standard approach to recruiting and backfilling roles simply won’t work at these levels of attrition. Organizations need data to get ahead of these turnover risks and take proactive steps to stop the exit. Retention Focus puts the power of these insights in every company’s reach.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">"Organizations are navigating the most unique labor market we’ve seen in decades,” said Jason Averbook, CEO and Co-Founder of LeapGen. “People are making decisions based on new criteria, and one of those decisions may be to leave your organization. But you can’t address what you can’t see; this is where Visier helps with early indicators, making people managers more effective when it comes to keeping the people who want to be kept."</span>\n\n<b>Guided Diversity Planning</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">--this new tailored offering is the first, and only, purpose-built workforce planning solution available for achieving diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) goals. Using Visier’s analytics and planning capabilities, this solution allows HR leaders and executives to set and work toward C-suite and board-level DEI goals, guided by data and predictive insights. This offering includes capabilities to:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set DEI goals in accordance with baseline metrics and guided by industry benchmarks.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perform sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of hiring and turnover on DEI goals.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define calculated, attainable goals that hiring managers and other internal stakeholders can work towards.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Companies are under pressure to transform their organization to become accurate reflections of the customers and communities they serve,” said Adam Binnie, Chief Product Officer at Visier. “Visier’s Guided Diversity Planning solution makes this goal an actionable program that produces actual DEI impact, not platitudes--which is exactly what customers, employees, and shareholders expect.” </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have already benefited from Visier’s headcount planning to ensure our actions today lead us to being the right-sized organization in the future,” said Gary Russo, Executive Director of Workforce Planning for Providence St. Joseph Health Shared Services. “Diversity planning is an exciting next step that will let us tune our DEI strategies to ensure we become right-shaped as well.”  </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement of Visier NOW comes on the heels of Visier’s </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/press-release/series-e-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$125 million Series E fundraising</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, led by Goldman Sachs, which places the company’s valuation over $1 billion.

      '<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New innovations offer more comparable people insights in the areas of compensation, promotion and career equity, a jumpstart on skills, and greater flexibility for self-service customization to all Visier customers</span></i>\n\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC – November 23, 2021</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the globally recognized leader in people analytics and planning, announced two new innovations that are immediately available to all Visier customers: Standardized Occupations and the Visier Certified Developer Program.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Standardized Occupations is now available as a no-charge option to Visier customers with the latest release. Standardized Occupations utilizes AI and the Emsi BurningGlass jobs structure to match an organization’s job names to a standardized list of job names and hierarchies. This removes one of the most critical barriers to understanding equity across compensation, promotion, career and retention programs by standardizing job names for like-to-like comparison. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not know that people are doing the same work, you cannot measure whether or not they are being treated fairly,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Ian Cook, VP, Analytics of Visier. “Every organization has to periodically spend what are often enormous sums of money on consulting projects to clean up their messy or mismatched job names. With Standardized Occupations, Visier now does the work for you, continuously augmenting your source data, building alignment across your organization, and ensuring you can always match your jobs internally and to the external market.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Through Standardized Occupations, Visier customers can: </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish a single common view of all jobs across their organization</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remove barriers to equitable compensation, promotion, and recognition decisions</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve career conversations and insights around internal mobility</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improve workforce planning and cost decisions</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Automatically know the top five expected skills for each role across your organization</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">people analytics teams who want a high degree of speed, flexibility and control when it comes to configuring and extending their Visier application can enroll in the Visier Certified Developer program. This </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unlocks a new level of self-service, providing access to the powerful developer toolset that is built into Visier itself. Certified Developers can quickly customize their existing solution, making the most of Visier’s rich set of analytic capabilities.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Certified Developer program is the latest step in making Visier even more flexible and valuable for  our customers,” said Adam Binnie, Chief Product Officer of Visier. “Now, certified developers will be able to use Visier’s rich analytical capabilities to customize the most complete out of the box people analytics solution on the market today. These developers can quickly add bespoke  metrics or update configurations to meet new requirements, delivering a new level of speed, flexibility and value to their organizations.” </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Standardized Occupations, and the Visier Certified Developer program are now available to all Visier customers and partners.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">More information about Visier can be found at </span><a href="http://www.visier.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.visier.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier is the recognized global leader in people analytics and workforce planning.  Founded in 2010 by the pioneers of business intelligence, Visier focuses on what matters to business leaders: answering the right questions, even the ones a person might not know to ask.

      '<p style="text-align: left;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Produced alongside Deloitte; Research, Editorial, and Webinars Provides a Vision for the Future of Management Where Leaders are Armed with Insights to Make a Difference—for Both Business and the Employee</span></i></p>\n<b>VANCOUVER, BC </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><b> Dec. </b><b>14</b><b>, 2021</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the globally recognized leader in people analytics and workforce planning solutions, today announced a new research and thought leadership series produced in conjunction with Deloitte. “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toward a People-Powered Future</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” envisions a paradigm shift in leadership, and a new direction for the future of management. This comes at a time when organizations are facing multiple converging crises related to a global pandemic, the “Great Resignation,” and a disrupted labor market—all of which have had a fundamental, and likely permanent, impact on hiring, retaining, and managing talent.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The future of work has arrived, but the way we manage people is still very much stuck in the past,” said Ryan Wong, Co-Founder and CEO of Visier. “Too often, leaders have relied on instinct and gut feel, bringing with it inherent and unconscious bias. Even when leaders have had data to guide decision making, it’s often incomplete. We see a future where leaders shift from managing capacity, activity, and outputs, to cultivating impacts, results, and outcomes. A future where we can see the impact employees have on the business, and the impact the business has on the employee.”</span>\n\n<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toward a People-Powered Future</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes an interactive </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/future-of-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed as a destination hub with resources of curated research and insights for leaders who want to help drive positive change in their own organizations and careers. Supporting this research, three joint webinars will be produced by Visier and Deloitte, including:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Leadership Imperatives in an Evolving World of Work - Jan 26, 2022, 11:00 - Noon ET. </span><a href="https://www.visier.com/future-of-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Register now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">!</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success Stories | Building the Foundation of a People-Powered Organization - March 17, 2022, 11:00 - Noon ET. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond HR | Leveraging People Analytics to Address Critical Business Issues - May 19, 2022, 11:00 - Noon ET. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditional approaches to people management are under extraordinary pressure. Recent </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/human-capital/articles/human-capital-trends-2021-special-report.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deloitte research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 86% of executives expect employees to gain influence and independence in relation to their employers. The sudden rise of remote work, a reckoning on diversity, equity and inclusion, and a growing resignation wave are just a few of the workforce challenges companies face as they navigate their own growth pressures. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“The employee/employer power dynamic has shifted dramatically,” said Jamaal Justice, managing director, Deloitte Consulting LLP. “But many companies still apply top-down management models that are yielding diminishing returns, or worse, causing employees to quit. The companies that thrive over the next 25 years will be the ones that make a pivot toward data-driven approaches to people management that are both holistic and humanistic.”</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“But data, alone, isn’t enough. Becoming truly people-powered is about a mindset shift: to a new relationship between leaders and employees, to a learning culture, to a new set of leadership capabilities, and to a more holistic understanding of the people—the individuals, the teams—and their relationship to business outcomes,” said Wong.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies use Visier to understand and improve their workforce at every stage of the employee lifecycle—from recruitment to retirement. Visier is designed to answer virtually any question leaders need to ask about their workforce to improve diversity and inclusion, performance and productivity, employee retention and happiness, and to more effectively plan hiring and career progression, and manage people, teams and business outcomes. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about this thought leadership series by visiting: </span><a href="http://www.visier.com/future-of-work"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.visier.com/future-of-work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>\n\n<b>About Visier</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier is the recognized global leader in people analytics and workforce planning.

      "Britain’s Burnout Crisis Companies risk mass exodus as more than half of young professionals feel ‘burnt out’ right now",
    Content:

During the past 18 months, as a direct result of work, all respondents flagged experiencing trouble sleeping (47%), exhaustion (46%) and negative thoughts (39%). Plus, nearly half of respondents (48%) admitted to getting agitated at partners, family members and friends. When asked what was contributing to these feelings of burnout, respondents cited shortage of employees (38%), long work hours (30%) and lack of reward and recognition (25%) as major contributing factors. </span>\n\n<b>Tackling retention challenges</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Britain\'s burnout problem is a challenge for retaining employees. According to the same survey, more than half (79%) of respondents have considered leaving their current job due to feelings of burnout. And, more than a third (38%) are actively job searching right now.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to burnt-out young professionals, the good news however, is that at least half of young professionals feel comfortable talking to their boss or manager about feelings of mental or physical exhaustion. </span>\n\n<b>Flexibility key to improving burnout </b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what, if anything, could reduce levels of burnout at work, more reward and recognition for the work that I do (41%), more flexibility in my working day (38%) and a better resourced team (37%) were all cited as key factors by those currently feeling burnt out at work. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all employees surveyed, more than a third (36%) of respondents said they would like to see employers implement more flexible working hours and more wellness programmes (32%) to reduce burnout in the workplace. </span>\n\n<b>Andrea Derler, </b><b>Principal for Research and Customer Value</b><b> of Visier said:</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Britain is currently undergoing an occupational health crisis. Burnout is becoming pervasive in our workplaces and employers need to act now to protect the wellbeing of their people or face the reality of a talent exodus. In particular, companies risk losing up and coming junior talent as burnout is becoming a generational issue – felt strongest by the Gen-Z and Millennial workforce. </span></i>\n\n<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Though time off work is an important way to recharge, it isn’t enough to alleviate chronic burnout. Leaders must understand how their people are feeling and engage employees in conversations about burnout using workplace tools to gauge their stress levels. Managers can then work with direct reports to alleviate work-related fatigue and provide crucial support. Only by identifying these feelings earlier on is it possible to act in time before the burnout crisis leads to voluntary turnover”.</span></i>\n\n<b>ENDS</b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information, please contact </span><a href="mailto:Visier@fightflight.co.uk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier@fightflight.co.uk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>\n\n<b>Research methodology </b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The research was conducted by Censuswide, among a sample of 2,007 part time and full time employees who have been in full or part time employment for at least a 12 month period.

Built atop Visier’s category defining people analytics platform, Visier People Cloud solves the ‘Last Mile’ problem that can limit the transformational potential of people analytics strategies: extending beyond HR departments by putting timely, relevant insights directly in the hands of leaders who manage people.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Business is nothing without people, but most people managers and executives are still flying blind,” said Ryan Wong, co-founder and CEO of Visier. “Visier People Cloud is designed to solve this problem by revealing the real human truth of business for leaders, answering two equally important questions: what impact are people having on the business–and what impact is the business having on people?” </span>\n<h2><b>Rethinking How Leaders Lead and How Managers Manage</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Visier People Cloud comes at a time when organizations are facing record-high resignation rates, and leaders are under pressure to rethink their social contract with employees. Employees want to know they’re making a difference for the business, but they also expect fairness, equity, and flexibility. Visier People Cloud shines light on the whole person so business and employees can win together.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">“At Providence, we’ve seen tremendous success using Visier to arm our people leaders with the data they need to make informed business decisions,” said Mark Smith, Vice President of Workforce Strategy &amp; Analytics at Providence, a comprehensive healthcare system serving the Western United States. “In order for modern day organizations to truly succeed, they need data in all forms to be working harmoniously, creating a holistic view of the health of the organization, and more importantly the state of its people.”</span>\n\n<a href="https://hello.visier.com/people-analytics-maturity-value-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier research</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has found that the most progressive organizations are already connecting people data with operational data and democratizing these insights to managers and executives. Successful organizations provide insights that support their people managers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> such as compensation analytics, total cost of workforce, and pay equity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Uber, for example, has reported that more than half of its people managers are using Visier to make better decisions about people and teams.</span>\n<h2><b>How Visier People Cloud Works</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visier People Cloud acts as a hub that brings together the people data scattered inside and outside an organization, connecting it with the operational and work data powering a business–arming managers and executives with a deeper human truth about their business. Specifically, Visier People Cloud:</span>\n\n<b>Connects people to business outcomes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–revealing how people and teams impact business goals and results related to revenue, delivery schedules, customer satisfaction, and the like. By connecting people to business outcomes, managers can make better decisions about hiring, promoting, compensation, training, and where and when to intervene to head off retention issues that could put business results at risk. For example, if a business plan targets 50% revenue growth, when and where should sales team hiring occur to reach that goal given historical ramp times and quota attainment?</span>\n\n<b>Democratizes people data to leaders who make the difference</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–extending people insights beyond HR and analytics teams to the managers and executives who are the most direct link to people and teams and are responsible for driving people-powered results for the business. People leaders are given targeted insights that help them see otherwise hidden opportunities and risks on their teams.</span>\n\n<b>Provides context for responsible and effective decisions</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">–provides a holistic view of the person and the business so managers and executives can make fair and balanced decisions that create shared accountability for performance but without adding to burnout risks; and includes the in-context explanations that help managers know how to interpret data and take effective, responsible actions.</span>\n<h2><b>People Cloud Custom Services</b></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also announced today is </span><a href="/customer-experience/professional-services#custom-services"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People Cloud Custom Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new valued-added professional services offering from Visier, which provides expert and research-based best-practice guidance, custom extensions, and implementation and adoption services for the Visier People Cloud.
